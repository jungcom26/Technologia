      "[260.96s -> 265.68s]  but it turns out to be a rock, and is all like Luop. He ends up on home,\n",
      "[265.68s -> 270.32s]  though his adventure suit he changed into is now ruined. Zooot feels bad about Paul\n",
      "[270.32s -> 276.00s]  not getting a turtle, so they offer to let Paul name theirs, to which he chooses Paul Jr.\n",
      "[276.00s -> 280.96s]  They eventually reach a clearing with a large stone outcrop covered in engraved shifting\n",
      "[281.60s -> 285.12s]  rooms. Carved into a stone is a large bronze door with a face on it.\n",
      "[286.16s -> 290.48s]  Oh, you should try to impress it. Oh, okay.\n",
      "[290.48s -> 306.08s]  Answer me, it's brittle street, and then you can pull in. Now I'm a real bear.\n",
      "[308.64s -> 317.68s]  The elephant there knows, okay, you can see. When I go from sea to a warrior bag,\n",
      "[318.24s -> 322.24s]  the elf of the bad words grow.\n",
      "[322.24s -> 328.24s]  Answer once he grow up, who needs that?\n",
      "[334.64s -> 341.60s]  I move without words between self-instructions. I think that's really fine.\n",
      "[341.60s -> 351.60s]  I'm going to say a spider because I got the butt streaks.\n",
      "[351.60s -> 358.60s]  Wait, but can you turn our front back?\n",
      "[358.60s -> 361.60s]  Oh yeah, no more nothing.\n",
      "[361.60s -> 366.60s]  And to this next we will and you'll find more people back.\n",
      "[366.60s -> 376.60s]  I think you all know I'm not your ears, but I could move the arm with my ears.\n",
      "[376.60s -> 379.60s]  What am I?\n",
      "[379.60s -> 384.60s]  Uh, can you use it in a sentence?\n",
      "[384.60s -> 387.60s]  Uh, you answered me.\n",
      "[387.60s -> 388.60s]  What is she?\n",
      "[388.60s -> 392.60s]  Yeah, like, like, spelling me style.\n",
      "[392.60s -> 402.60s]  I think I picked up on it.\n",
      "[402.60s -> 406.60s]  I don't know if you noticed, but he said warm on accident.\n",
      "[406.60s -> 408.60s]  I'm very detail oriented.\n",
      "[408.60s -> 412.60s]  Oh, listen to him, listen to him, listen to him all.\n",
      "[412.60s -> 415.60s]  Paul Jr. what do you think the answer is?\n",
      "[415.60s -> 417.60s]  I can turn it off.\n",
      "[417.60s -> 418.60s]  Turn it off, finally.\n",
      "[418.60s -> 419.60s]  It's a warm.\n",
      "[419.60s -> 426.60s]  The adventures walk through the door's mouth, which closes behind them.\n",
      "[426.60s -> 430.60s]  As they're walking into an open room, they're greeted by a closed silver door.\n",
      "[430.60s -> 433.60s]  Zooida immediately pitches the turtle at the door, but nothing happens.\n",
      "[433.60s -> 439.60s]  There's three dishes of clay placed in front of three pedestals, and the door face emerges once again.\n",
      "[439.60s -> 445.60s]  This time on the ceiling.\n",
      "[446.60s -> 450.60s]  Not wanting to deal with more riddles, zoo throws a dagger into the door's eye.\n",
      "[450.60s -> 455.60s]  Ah, two, four is that man helping you with this one.\n",
      "[455.60s -> 461.60s]  The group now lost with no direction, decides for some reason to all start eating the clay,\n",
      "[461.60s -> 464.60s]  even feeding some to Paul Jr. and Wop against their wheels.\n",
      "[464.60s -> 473.60s]  After all the clay has been consumed, the pillars glow red, and more clay drops down from the ceiling, resetting the puzzle.\n",
      "[473.60s -> 474.60s]  Huh.\n",
      "[474.60s -> 477.60s]  Out of ideas, they decide to do what the door face suggested.\n",
      "[477.60s -> 482.60s]  Salamu sculpts a crown, zoo rolls out a worm, and Paul builds a penguin.\n",
      "[482.60s -> 487.60s]  They all place their creations on pedestals, which sink in and beam green before the lights turn out,\n",
      "[487.60s -> 488.60s]  and everything goes dark.\n",
      "[488.60s -> 494.60s]  They flash back on and suddenly all their creations have come to life, and weird, clay flesh bodies.\n",
      "[494.60s -> 496.60s]  Paul leaves that as a penguin with great acts.\n",
      "[496.60s -> 500.60s]  Nearly cutting it clean half, revealing that the inside is just more clay.\n",
      "[500.60s -> 505.60s]  The worm monster looks at you, and says, it's warm in time, causing zoo to scream,\n",
      "[505.60s -> 510.60s]  and sending a shockwave towards it, immediately sporting the worm, and splattering clay everywhere,\n",
      "[510.60s -> 512.60s]  living as a normal sized worm now.\n",
      "[512.60s -> 516.60s]  The worm lunges and wraps itself around zoo's throat trying to choke them out.\n",
      "[516.60s -> 520.60s]  Salamu rips the arms off the crown monster, and dodges its follow-up attack.\n",
      "[520.60s -> 527.60s]  The penguin reforms itself, sprints full speed at Paul, but slips and splats into a pile of clay on the ground,\n",
      "[527.60s -> 529.60s]  to which Paul finishes off with his acts.\n",
      "[529.60s -> 534.60s]  Meanwhile, Thalamu attempts to rip the legs off the crown, only for the crown legs to turn into arms,\n",
      "[534.60s -> 538.60s]  grabbing Thalamu and climbing onto their head, causing them to lose their mind.\n",
      "[538.60s -> 542.60s]  Viewing the other party members has enemies, Paul shifts his attention to Thalamu,\n",
      "[542.60s -> 545.60s]  throwing his great acts horizontally at the crown.\n",
      "[545.60s -> 549.60s]  Unfortunately, it goes a bit low, and the handle smacks Thalamu directly in the face.\n",
      "[549.60s -> 555.60s]  Zoo'd gets a grip on the worm, ripping it off their throat, and breeds acid onto it until it's reduced to ash.\n",
      "[555.60s -> 560.60s]  Thalamu blows on their bagpipes to attack Paul, sending out a thunderous shockwave that shakes the cavern.\n",
      "[560.60s -> 566.60s]  Paul is able to hold his ground, runs up to the two, and successfully cleaves the crown off Thalamu's head.\n",
      "[566.60s -> 568.60s]  All the clay monsters have been defeated.\n",
      "[568.60s -> 572.60s]  The silver door opens, and everyone cheers together in celebration.\n",
      "[572.60s -> 581.60s]  The adventures enter the new room to be created by wooden structures, spiral staircases, platforms, and a golden door at the very back wall.\n",
      "[581.60s -> 586.60s]  It looks like a camp is set up inside the area, and voices can be heard above on one of the platforms.\n",
      "[586.60s -> 590.60s]  Thalamu scans the area, looking for traces of their neighbor, Thompson.\n",
      "[590.60s -> 597.60s]  Not only do they discover a pack of goblins that have inhabited the area, but he also recognizes a familiar boot print in the clay.\n",
      "[597.60s -> 601.60s]  It's the same type, Thompson, where's he's been here.\n",
      "[601.60s -> 604.60s]  Paul climbs up to the goblin platform and sparks conversation.\n",
      "[604.60s -> 610.60s]  The goblins are confused and a bit wary of the intruders, but introduce themselves nonetheless.\n",
      "[610.60s -> 617.60s]  I'm Gobb, that's Gobble, that's Gobble Gobb, and that's the peeler.\n",
      "[617.60s -> 619.60s]  And who's that?\n",
      "[619.60s -> 621.60s]  That's Bloy.\n",
      "[621.60s -> 628.60s]  So, your names are Gobb, Gobble, Gobble, Gobble Gobble, Peeler, and Bloyle, Gobble, and Bloyle, Gobble, and Bloyle.\n",
      "[628.60s -> 629.60s]  I've got it.\n",
      "[629.60s -> 631.60s]  So, your name is the peeler.\n",
      "[631.60s -> 634.60s]  You don't know anything about Mark Thompson.\n",
      "[634.60s -> 637.60s]  I only know about one thing.\n",
      "[637.60s -> 639.60s]  And that's peeler.\n",
      "[639.60s -> 640.60s]  Yeah!\n",
      "[640.60s -> 642.60s]  Great, very good.\n",
      "[642.60s -> 643.60s]  Oh, jeeds.\n",
      "[643.60s -> 645.60s]  Okay, alright, alright, we're leaving!\n",
      "[645.60s -> 648.60s]  Paul starts booking it to the door that came in through.\n",
      "[648.60s -> 650.60s]  The peeler right on his tail, stabbing at his ankles.\n",
      "[650.60s -> 653.60s]  No one else is doing or saying anything, they're just watching.\n",
      "[653.60s -> 658.60s]  Paul makes it back to the previous room, and the peeler slinks into the shadows.\n",
      "[658.60s -> 661.60s]  With Paul in the other room, and Thalamu and Zoot, unable to speak Goblin,\n",
      "[661.60s -> 665.60s]  Thalamu is left trying to communicate through improvised sign language,\n",
      "[665.60s -> 669.60s]  pointing at the door and blowing kisses at the Goblins to signal peace.\n",
      "[669.60s -> 671.60s]  Zoot tries to slip around the Goblins in the meantime,\n",
      "[671.60s -> 673.60s]  as communication is clearly not working,\n",
      "[673.60s -> 675.60s]  and the Goblins are only getting more aggressive,\n",
