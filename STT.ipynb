      "[434.24s -> 437.60s]  There's three dishes of clay placed in front of three pedestals,\n",
      "[437.68s -> 441.12s]  and the door face emerges once again, this time on the ceiling.\n",
      "[446.24s -> 450.16s]  Not wanting to deal with more riddles, zooot throws a dagger into the door's eye.\n",
      "[455.76s -> 461.36s]  The group now lost with no direction, decides for some reason to all start eating the clay,\n",
      "[461.36s -> 464.88s]  even feeding some to Paul Jr. and Wop against their wheels.\n",
      "[464.88s -> 468.64s]  After all, the clay has been consumed, the pillars glow red,\n",
      "[468.64s -> 472.16s]  and more clay drops down from the ceiling, resetting the puzzle.\n",
      "[473.76s -> 477.68s]  Huh, out of ideas, they decide to do what the door face suggested.\n",
      "[477.68s -> 482.40s]  Salamu sculpts a crown, zooot rolls out a worm, and Paul builds a penguin.\n",
      "[482.40s -> 488.00s]  They all place their creations on pedestals, which sink in and being green before the lights turn out,\n",
      "[488.00s -> 492.24s]  and everything goes dark. They flash back on and suddenly all their creations have come to life\n",

      "[504.48s -> 507.92s]  causing Zooot to scream and sending a shockwave towards it.\n",
      "[507.92s -> 511.52s]  Immediately sporting the worm and splattering clay everywhere,\n",
      "[511.52s -> 516.08s]  living as a normal sized worm now. The worm lunges and wraps itself around Zooot's throat\n",
      "[516.08s -> 519.68s]  trying to choke them out. Salamu rips the arms off the crown monster,\n",
      "[519.68s -> 522.88s]  and dodges its follow-up attack. The penguin reforms itself,\n",
      "[522.88s -> 527.84s]  sprints full speed at Paul, but slips and splats into a pile of clay on the ground,\n",
      "[527.84s -> 532.48s]  to which Paul finishes off with his acts. Meanwhile, Thalamu attempts to rip the legs up\n",
      "[532.48s -> 536.88s]  the crown, only for the crown legs to turn into arms, grabbing Thalamu and climbing\n",
      "[536.88s -> 541.44s]  under their head, causing them to lose their mind, viewing the other party members as enemies.\n",
      "[541.44s -> 545.68s]  Paul shifts his attention to Thalamu, throwing his great acts horizontally at the crown.\n",
      "[545.68s -> 550.00s]  Unfortunately, it goes a bit low, and the handle smacks Thalamu directly in the face.\n",
      "[550.00s -> 552.72s]  Zooot gets a grip on the worm, ripping it off their throat,\n",
      "[552.72s -> 557.28s]  and breeds acid onto it until it's reduced to ash. Thalamu blows on their bagpipe\n",

      "[578.64s -> 583.76s]  platforms, and a golden door at the very back wall. It looks like a camp is set up inside the\n",

       "TaskResult(messages=[TextMessage(source='user', models_usage=None, metadata={}, content=\"Summarize this session:\\n Dungeons & Dragons is like a board game without the board and you play using your imagination.  If you think of something, it can just happen in game.  D&D is very popular, almost everyone I've ever met absolutely loves it,  and I have never played it before, even though I always thought I would really like it.  People would tell me stories of their games like,  so this one time me and my party were entering a cave,  and there was a big ogre guarding some treasure,  but I used my charisma stat to seduce him,  and we ended up aloping together.  Dude, if you don't think that sounds crazy fun,  then I don't think we would get along, and you should probably answer to crime.  But if you do think that sounds fun, then hey!  Sorry, I've never done that before, it felt weird.  I decided to reach out to Charlie, aka Slimesicle, aka Charlie Slimesicle,  because he's super into D&D, and we ended up forming a little group of me,  Alfred Ron Boo is the players, and Charlie is the Dungeon Master,  which is like the game organizer slash manager slash god.  We all created our characters and into the world we were teleported.  The clouds part over a vast lush forest.  In it, a giant ancient oak tree can be found looming over all the other trees.  The inside has been hollowed out, and the sign hangs on the side,  reading old oak in.  Inside, many creatures of various origins are relaxing,  drinking socializing, but one stands out.  A cat, equipped with various instruments,  sits at a table, leaning over their cup of milk and scanning the room.  They spot a dragonborn drinking at the bar,  alone, seemingly pondering life.  From the other end of the bar, a man in a suit approaches the dragon,  and starts a casual conversation.  Do you know Mark?  No, I don't.  Who are you?  I'm Paul, I'm an assistant manager at Yeold Mart of Wall,  43 years old.  My wife passed away during childbirth.  My parents died, and my only child, Paul Jr.  ran away at age six.  I'm living a deadbeat life, not even able to go up in the corporate ladder,  because my manager, Mark, prevents me from doing so.  So here I am, drinking away my wolves.  I'm a zoo.  Excuse me, are you two new around here?  Or in the raise, I wish I was.  Okay, so I've been stuck in a time loop for what I believe to be the past three years.  I really have the same day over and over.  I suspect my neighbor Thomas somehow trapped me here,  but I don't know how to escape.  I can't prove it.  Look, over there.  In about five seconds, there's a 70% chance.  A waiter is going to trip and drop their glasses onto the ground.  Well, all right, it was a bit impressive,  but it's going to take a bit more convincing  because that wasn't all that.  Suddenly, a sheep crashes through the tavern windows  and starts rampaging around the in.  It's going straight up crazy, knocking over tables, docking over people.  Paul mentions, it's got something in its mouth,  and the sheep immediately stops and runs straight up to him.  As Paul takes what seems to be a scroll out of the sheep's mouth,  zooed whips out their mace in an attempt to pepper spray the sheep,  but slips on a puddle of rum and accidentally sprays Paul,  who just is disappointed at this point.  The three open the scroll and zooed,  recognizing it's a speak with animals spell,  translates it, casting a huge shockwave  and blasting everything in its radius.  Um, hello, can you understand me now?  Why the fuck?  Did you try to spray me with mace?  Zooed and the sheep start bickering as Paul and Tholomew just stare at them.  Just forget it, forget it.  I'm no ordinary sheep.  I used to be human and I was cursed into a sheep's body.  My name is Luop and I need your help becoming human again.  Please.  All right, Luop, it's Luop. Come on, guys, let's go.  And for some reason, they all went along with it.  Still not understanding what the hell is going on.  Maybe they both thought they could find their arch enemies,  Mark and Thompson along the way.  The group is walking through the woods.  Tholomew is very on edge feeling like something isn't quite right.  The tree line is shifting in unnatural ways.  Oak trees are turning into birch, the bushes are rustling.  Zooed spots are various random animals along the path and picks up a turtle,  which they add to their inventory.  Paul tries to pocket a turtle of his own, but it turns out to be a rock.  And his name is all like Luop.  He ends up on home, though, his adventure suit he changed into is now ruined.  Zooed feels bad about Paul not getting a turtle, so they offer to let Paul name theirs,  to which he chooses Paul Jr.  They eventually reach a clearing with a large stone outcrop covered in engraved shifting rooms.  Carved into a stone is a large bronze door with a face on it.  Oh, you should try to impress it.  Oh, okay.  The elephant goes okay to see if my eye goes from she to a warrior bag.  The elephant that backwards grows.  The answer once he brought food to that.  I'm going to say a spider because I got the bud streaks.  Oh, wait, but can you turn our bread back?  Oh, yeah, no more nothing.  Answer this next wiggle and you'll find more to turn back.  I can't wait, but I can move the earth with my hands.  What am I?  Uh, can you use it in a sentence?  Oh, no, no, what is she?  Yeah, like, like, spelling me style.  No one's trying that you're not going to work your way out of this.  Damn, hmm, I think I picked up on it.  I don't know if you noticed, but he said worm on accident.  I'm very detailed oriented.  Oh, listen to him, listen to him all.  Paul Jr., what do you think the answer is?  Turtle.  Turtle, finally it's a worm.  The adventurers walk through the door's mouth, which closes behind them.  As they're walking into an open room, they're greeted by a closed silver door.  Zooida immediately pitches the turtle at the door, but nothing happens.  There's three dishes of clay placed in front of three pedestals,  and the door face emerges once again, this time on the ceiling.  Not wanting to deal with more riddles, zooot throws a dagger into the door's eye.  The group now lost with no direction, decides for some reason to all start eating the clay,  even feeding some to Paul Jr. and Wop against their wheels.  After all, the clay has been consumed, the pillars glow red,  and more clay drops down from the ceiling, resetting the puzzle.  Huh, out of ideas, they decide to do what the door face suggested.  Salamu sculpts a crown, zooot rolls out a worm, and Paul builds a penguin.  They all place their creations on pedestals, which sink in and being green before the lights turn out,  and everything goes dark. They flash back on and suddenly all their creations have come to life  and weird clay flesh bodies. Paul leaves that as a penguin with great acts.  Nearly cutting it clean half, revealing that the inside is just more clay.  The worm monster looks at Zoo, and says, it's warm in time,  causing Zooot to scream and sending a shockwave towards it.  Immediately sporting the worm and splattering clay everywhere,  living as a normal sized worm now. The worm lunges and wraps itself around Zooot's throat  trying to choke them out. Salamu rips the arms off the crown monster,  and dodges its follow-up attack. The penguin reforms itself,  sprints full speed at Paul, but slips and splats into a pile of clay on the ground,  to which Paul finishes off with his acts. Meanwhile, Thalamu attempts to rip the legs up  the crown, only for the crown legs to turn into arms, grabbing Thalamu and climbing  under their head, causing them to lose their mind, viewing the other party members as enemies.  Paul shifts his attention to Thalamu, throwing his great acts horizontally at the crown.  Unfortunately, it goes a bit low, and the handle smacks Thalamu directly in the face.  Zooot gets a grip on the worm, ripping it off their throat,  and breeds acid onto it until it's reduced to ash. Thalamu blows on their bagpipe  to attack Paul, sending out a thunderous shockwave that shakes the cavern.  Paul is able to hold his ground, runs up to the two, and successfully  moves the crown off Thalamu's head. All the clay monsters have been defeated.  The silver door opens, and everyone cheers together in celebration.  The adventures enter the new room to be created by wooden structures, spiral staircases,  platforms, and a golden door at the very back wall. It looks like a camp is set up inside the  area, and voices can be heard above on one of the platforms. Thalamu scans the area,  looking for traces of their neighbor, Thompson. Not only do they discover a pack of  goblins that have inhabited the area, but he also recognizes a familiar boot print in the clay.  It's the same type Thompson wears. He's been here. Paul climbs up to the goblin platform  in Spark's conversation. The goblins are confused in a bit wary of the intruders,  but introduce themselves nonetheless. I'm Gob, that's Gobble, that's Gobble Gobble, and that's the  peeler. And who's that? It's Bloy. So your names are Gob, Gobble, Gobble, Gobble,  Gobble Gobble, Peeler, and Bloyle, Gobble, and Gobble, and Gobble. So your name is the peeler. You don't  know anything about Mark Thompson. I only know about one thing, and that's peeler. Yeah! Great,  there you go. Oh, jeeds. Okay, all right, all right, we're leaving. Paul starts  booking it to the door that came in through. The peeler right on his tail, stabbing at his ankles.  No analysis is doing or saying anything, they're just watching. Paul makes it back to the previous  room, and the peeler slinks into the shadows. With Paul in the other room in Thalamu and Zoot  unable to speak Goblin, Thalamu is left trying to communicate through improvised sign language,  pointing at the door and blowing kisses at the Goblins to signal peace. Zoot tries to slip around  the Goblins in the meantime, as communication is clearly not working, and the Goblins are only  getting more aggressive, but they bump into an invisible force they can't see, alerting the Goblins,  who are now initiating combat. Zoot decides to keep running to the door as Thalamu bangs on their  drum, sending sound shock moves if you attack in Goblins. Gobble, Gobble, and Gobble are all sent  flying off the edge of the platform, falling to their depths. Gobble, Gob, in a fit of rage after  losing his friends, lunges at Thalamu, but misses completely, sending himself off the edge of the  platform too. The peeler emerges from the shadows to lunge at Thalamu, who is taking up loyal,  but Paul jumps in just in time, clashing blades with him. As everyone is distracted, Zoot gets to the door,  peeking in to see an entirely golden room with a small golden rod shaped like a tree branch  floating at the center. The branch shifts between valuable materials at one moment being made of  gold, then emerald, and Ruby. Gobble Gobble with the Goblin that accidentally dove off the  side of the platform, sprints back up the stairs and attempts to tackle Thalamu off the platform,  but accidentally leaps over him, and plummets once again over the edge. This time,  to his demise, Paul and Thalamu perform a clumsy team attack together and finish off the peeler,  ending the battle, but because of the uncoordinated attack, Paul's axe is now peeled. They all  hurry over to Zoot and enter the golden room together, trying to figure out how to get the artifact down.  Zoot suggests they all toss Lop into the air to get it down, so Paul's so long be Bowser's  the sheep into the air, but in the complete opposite direction, Thalamu quickly runs over and breaks  his fall, and before Lop can say anything, they throw him again. This time hitting their target  as they both fall to the ground. No one stops Lop's fall this time as he lays motionless on the floor.  As Thalamu's healing of Lop, Zoot approaches the wand only for it to be snatched by an invisible force,  an unseen figure that reveals itself. Well, hey, they're neighbor. Oh, and Paul. It's me.  You're good friend. Mark Thompson. Do it! Thalamu, you ruined my life. It's right.  Paul's rumors about me. You said I curse you, and now no one wants to talk to me. My wife and  kids left me. Everyone avoid me, so I spent years becoming a dark wizard, and I'm going to have my  revenge. What about me? And you, Paul. Anyway, yeah, you are going to be spending the rest of your  lives here in this shift to the sanctum. I'll be going now. Though a new quickly cast,  locate object on the wand, Mark is now holding the throws ink in the general direction,  hoping to reveal where Mark is, but unfortunately, Zoot's words in the direction Thalamu  indicated, and attempts to tackle the air. The main contact, but bounce off of Mark's rock saw  and beer gun, breaking the invisibility spell. Thalamu whips out their drums, slamming it with  the intent to cast a thunder wave on Mark, sending him flying from the effect. Zoot follows behind  and shouts to depression. Casting a command spell on him, he stops in his tracks, facing Zoot,  and says, I'm so sad, having never dealt with depression before. He pulls out a picture of  his ex-wife and kids and just stares at it, longingly. Paul and Thalamu see their chance to attack  him, and once again, try to use an ultimate team attack. They grip Paul's peeled acts together  and throw it in tandem at Mark. But once again, they mess up, and Thalamu is accidentally sent  flying with the axe as appears as Mark's chest. Mark is unfazed, still wallowing in his depression.  But Zoot sees this as an opportunity, casting disguise self and visually turning themselves into  Mark's ex-wife. Ella, is that you? It is Mark, Mark drops the photo and wand, sobbing  and slowly walks towards Zoot, who has their arms out, ready for his embrace. He grabs Zoot and pulls  them close. Tears stream you down his face. It's been so hard. It's okay. I'm a year now.  Zoot pulls back just a bit, just to look into Mark's eyes, which are sparkling with tears.  And proceeds to ask the glass to him point blank from the mouth.  Mark is heavily damaged, but alive, snapping back to reality, and throwing Paul's axe to the ground.  If I can't have the one, no one can. Paul picks up one part of his peeled acts, looks like the  manager position just opened up. He throws the axe and hits Mark, but doesn't kill him. He then  picks up the other peeled axe part to throw as well, but it boomerings around and hits him in the back  head. Follow me grabs the wand from the ground and points it at Mark. This is for everything.  The low tax return. The restraining order for moving in next to me. You're my personal house!  Mark turns to Paul while being his after the wand. Would you still let me be your manager even if I was  in. You're fired. If you guys did it, please use the wand to turn me back into a human.  Please, follow me who casts the wand powers until off. Finally turning him back into a  original form. Paul and now human lo up, walk eyes. Hi dad, Paul Jr. Is that you?  Oh, Paul and his long-lost son, Paul Jr. embrace the wand. Now all out of magic crumbles and  does the party exit the game. The bomb is done. The explosions are up behind them. The group walks  off together. Thanks for watching this was a different type of video, but I hope you enjoyed it.  Especially big thanks to Charlie Rambu and Jacob for the great D&D session. It was super fun and I  really want to play more. I'd like to upload highlights of the actual D&D session to my second channel  eventually, but it's not ready yet, because I am bad at planning. So maybe that will happen one day.  Anyway, this was a big project. Thank you to the team as always and to serve me out for the  sound effects. Links to everyone are in the description.
