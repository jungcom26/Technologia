      "[281.60s -> 285.20s]  Carved into a stone is a large bronze door with a face on it.\n",
      "[286.16s -> 289.20s]  Oh, you should try to impress it.\n",
      "[289.20s -> 290.48s]  Oh, okay.\n",

      "[352.12s -> 358.12s]  Wait, but can you turn our front back?\n",
      "[358.12s -> 362.12s]  Oh yeah, no more nothing.\n",
      "[362.12s -> 367.12s]  Answer this next video and you'll find me to turn back.\n",
      "[367.12s -> 377.12s]  I keep thinking, well, no eyes like Zora ears, but I can move the arm with my ears.\n",
      "[377.12s -> 380.12s]  What am I?\n",
      "[380.12s -> 387.12s]  Um, can you use it in a sentence?\n",
      "[387.12s -> 401.12s]  Yeah, like spelling me style.\n",
      "[401.12s -> 403.12s]  I think I picked up on it.\n",

      "[407.12s -> 413.12s]  I'm very detail oriented.\n",

      "[418.12s -> 419.12s]  Turtle, finally.\n",
      "[419.12s -> 423.12s]  It's a warm.\n",
      "[423.12s -> 426.12s]  The adventures walk through the door's mouth, which closes behind them.\n",
      "[426.12s -> 430.12s]  As they're walking into an open room, they're greeted by a closed silver door.\n",
      "[430.12s -> 434.12s]  Zuda immediately pitches the turtle at the door, but nothing happens.\n",
      "[434.12s -> 439.12s]  There's three dishes of clay placed in front of three pedestals, and the door face emerges once again.\n",
      "[439.12s -> 445.12s]  This time on the ceiling.\n",
      "[445.12s -> 455.12s]  Not wanting to deal with more riddles, Zuda throws a dagger into the door's eye.\n",
      "[455.12s -> 461.12s]  The group now lost with no direction, decides for some reason to all start eating the clay.\n",
      "[461.12s -> 465.12s]  Even feeding some to Paul Jr. and Wop against their wheels.\n",
      "[465.12s -> 471.12s]  After all the clay has been consumed, the pillars glow red, and more clay drops down from the ceiling.\n",
      "[471.12s -> 473.12s]  Resetting the puzzle.\n",
      "[473.12s -> 474.12s]  Huh.\n",
      "[474.12s -> 478.12s]  Out of ideas, they decide to do what the door face suggested.\n",
      "[478.12s -> 479.12s]  Salamu sculpts a crown.\n",
      "[479.12s -> 482.12s]  Zuda rolls out a worm, and Paul builds a penguin.\n",
      "[482.12s -> 489.12s]  They all place their creations on pedestals, which sink in and beam green before the lights turn out, and everything goes dark.\n",
      "[489.12s -> 494.12s]  They flash back on, and suddenly all their creations have come to life, and weird clay flesh bodies.\n",
      "[494.12s -> 496.12s]  Paul pleaves that as penguins.\n",
      "[496.12s -> 497.12s]  Great acts.\n",
      "[497.12s -> 501.12s]  Nearly cutting it clean half, revealing that the inside is just more clay.\n",
      "[501.12s -> 503.12s]  The worm monster looks at you, and says,\n",
      "[503.12s -> 508.12s]  It's warm in time, causing Zuda to scream and sending a shockwave towards it.\n",
      "[508.12s -> 513.12s]  Immediately exploding the worm and splattering clay everywhere, living as a normal sized worm now.\n",
      "[513.12s -> 517.12s]  The worm lunges and wraps itself around Zuda's throat trying to choke them out.\n",
      "[517.12s -> 521.12s]  Salamu rips the arms off the crown monster, and dodges its follow-up attack.\n",
      "[521.12s -> 530.12s]  The penguin reforms itself, sprints full speed at Paul, but slips and splats into a pile of clay on the ground, to which Paul finishes off with his acts.\n",
      "[530.12s -> 535.12s]  Meanwhile, Salamu attempts to rip the legs off the crown, only for the crown legs to turn into arms,\n",
      "[535.12s -> 539.12s]  grabbing Salamu and climbing onto their head, causing them to lose their mind.\n",
      "[539.12s -> 543.12s]  Viewing the other party members' enemies, Paul shifts his attention to Salamu,\n",
      "[543.12s -> 545.12s]  throwing his great acts horizontally at the crown.\n",
      "[545.12s -> 549.12s]  Unfortunately, it goes a bit low when the handle smacks Salamu directly in the face.\n",
      "[549.12s -> 555.12s]  Zuda gets a grip on the worm, ripping it off their throat, and breathes acid onto it until it's reduced to ash.\n",
      "[555.12s -> 561.12s]  Salamu blows on their bagpipes to attack Paul, sending out a thunderous shockwave that shakes the cavern.\n",
      "[561.12s -> 566.12s]  Paul is able to hold his ground, runs up to the two, and successfully queues the crown off Salamu's head.\n",
      "[566.12s -> 568.12s]  All the clay monsters have been defeated.\n",
      "[568.12s -> 572.12s]  The silver door opens, and everyone cheers together in celebration.\n",
      "[573.12s -> 582.12s]  The adventure is entered the new room, to be created by wooden structures, spiral staircases, platforms, and a golden door at the very back wall.\n",
      "[582.12s -> 587.12s]  It looks like a camp is set up inside the area, and voices can be heard above on one of the platforms.\n",
      "[587.12s -> 591.12s]  Though in these scans, the area, looking for traces of their neighbor, Thompson.\n",
      "[591.12s -> 598.12s]  Not only do they discover a pack of goblins that have inhabited the area, but he also recognizes a familiar boot print in the clay.\n",
      "[598.12s -> 600.12s]  It's the same type Thompson wears.\n",
      "[600.12s -> 601.12s]  He's been here.\n",
      "[601.12s -> 604.12s]  Paul climbs up to the Goblin platform and sparks conversation.\n",
      "[604.12s -> 610.12s]  The goblins are confused in a bit wary of the intruders, but introduce themselves nonetheless.\n",
      "[610.12s -> 614.12s]  I'm Gobb. That's Gobble. That's Gobble Gobb.\n",
      "[614.12s -> 617.12s]  And that's the peeler.\n",
      "[617.12s -> 619.12s]  And who's that?\n",
      "[619.12s -> 621.12s]  It's Gloy.\n",
      "[621.12s -> 627.12s]  So your names are Gobb, Gobble, Gobble, Gobble, Gobble Gobb, Peeler, and Voil.\n",
      "[627.12s -> 629.12s]  Stop, peeler.\n",
      "[629.12s -> 630.12s]  I've got it.\n",
      "[630.12s -> 632.12s]  So your name is the peeler.\n",
      "[632.12s -> 635.12s]  You don't know anything about Mark Thompson.\n",
      "[635.12s -> 638.12s]  I only know about one thing.\n",
      "[638.12s -> 639.12s]  And that's peeler.\n",
      "[639.12s -> 640.12s]  Yeah!\n",
      "[640.12s -> 642.12s]  Great, very good.\n",
      "[642.12s -> 643.12s]  Oh, jeeds.\n",
      "[643.12s -> 645.12s]  Okay, all right, all right, we're leaving.\n",
      "[645.12s -> 648.12s]  Paul starts booking it to the door that came in through.\n",
      "[648.12s -> 651.12s]  The peeler right on his tail, stabbing at his ankles.\n",
      "[651.12s -> 654.12s]  No one else is doing or saying anything, they're just watching.\n",
      "[654.12s -> 658.12s]  Paul makes it back to the previous room and the peeler slinks into the shadows.\n",
      "[658.12s -> 662.12s]  With Paul in the other room, and Thalamu and Zoot unable to speak Goblin,\n",
      "[662.12s -> 666.12s]  Thalamu is left trying to communicate through improvised sign language,\n",
      "[666.12s -> 670.12s]  pointing at the door and blowing kisses at the Goblins to signal peace.\n",
      "[670.12s -> 674.12s]  Zoot tries to slip around the Goblins in the meantime as communication is clearly not working,\n",
      "[674.12s -> 676.12s]  and the Goblins are only getting more aggressive,\n",
      "[676.12s -> 679.12s]  but they bump into an invisible force they can't see,\n",
