[0.00s → 4.56s] We are extremely excited to present something we've been working on for quite some time.
[4.56s → 9.60s] You've asked for us to play D&D for quite a while, and we heard you, and we did the thing.
[9.60s → 11.44s] Welcome to Sword AF!
[14.64s → 20.64s] All right, I've been working on this campaign and making it from scratch for a few months now.
[21.36s → 24.40s] It's been a huge collaborative effort from the Smosh Games team.
[24.40s → 28.48s] So if you're new here, why don't we go around the table and meet all our Smosh Games players
[28.48s → 34.16s] for our first campaign? Hi, my name's Shane. I've played D&D a couple times before,
[34.16s → 38.24s] but I think this is going to be the real one for me. This is going to be my first like deep dive.
[38.24s → 44.08s] I'm stoked. Hi, I'm Angela. I've played D&D before. 5-5 is my height.
[46.08s → 50.64s] Hi, I'm Damien Haas. I've been on Smosh Games for a while, and I've been playing D&D here and
[50.64s → 56.72s] there. I usually join friends campaigns as like a guest, and this is my first time DMing a full campaign.
[56.72s → 64.72s] Hi guys, I'm Amanda, and I have not played D&D, and I'm so excited to discover and go on this
[64.72s → 70.64s] journey with everybody. Hey, what's up? I'm Chance. I've played D&D before. I've been in one campaign
[70.64s → 76.96s] for like two years now, but I'm a new class and a new race, so I'm trying new things. Let us begin
[76.96s → 84.56s] our story. The Age of Heroes, a time when all of creation, whether mundane or magical,
[84.56s → 90.64s] lives in constant fear of the darkness that lurks around every corner. But in this era of great
[90.64s → 96.72s] peril, there also hangs in the air a sense of opportunity for those that are exceptionally strong,
[97.36s → 106.96s] or wise, or clever, or brave, to seize back control of their own narratives and rise as legendary heroes
[106.96s → 112.08s] to forever etch their names in the annals of history. Now, that age has recently passed,
[112.16s → 117.20s] with dragons being slain, wars being won, lines being drawn in the sand, and people living in
[117.20s → 122.64s] relative comfort now, and peace. But with everybody growing up hearing about these heroes,
[122.64s → 128.08s] it was generally expected that you would yourselves become one one day. So mercenary groups
[128.08s → 132.08s] roamed the land, taking on whatever job is available. Though now in this time of peace,
[132.08s → 136.32s] they are few and far between, and there are far too many mercenary groups that going to have to
[136.32s → 143.84s] adapt to Megan's meat. Our story begins in Seraphel, a bustling city on the western shore,
[143.84s → 150.16s] as a huge hub of trade and culture, creatures of all shapes and sizes make their way here to find
[150.16s → 155.84s] whatever destiny has in store. And today, a meeting of one of the most recognizable mercenary troops
[155.84s → 160.72s] has been ordered. But instead of their normal headquarters, the members have instead been ordered to
[160.72s → 167.84s] meet where all good adventures start at a tavern. I knew it. No, you played before. You got
[167.84s → 176.64s] to start that way. We first see a small goblin of bluish skin, sontering up right on time,
[176.64s → 182.00s] eager as a beaver to the front of this tavern. Tell us a little bit about this person.
[182.00s → 188.72s] I'm Bug. I'm also a cleric of the Trickster domain, and I'm a goblin. I'm looking around. I know
[188.72s → 193.68s] I'm going to start working with some new people. I'm really excited. And I go straight to the bar.
[193.68s → 198.00s] I'm, you know, when people are excited and they're standing on the edge of their toes, I'm doing
[198.00s → 203.76s] that, and I'm walking back and forth, and I keep my, I have a hammer that's really, really shiny,
[203.76s → 209.28s] and I keep looking at it, and I keep like adjusting my gauges, and because you can adjust them, you know.
[210.96s → 215.28s] And it's just really first day of school energy coming from Bug.
[215.28s → 222.88s] While Bug is at the bar, right on time, never early, never late, we see an older halfling
[222.88s → 227.76s] walk into the bar. Can you tell us a little bit about that, Amanda? I am Dolores Paradise,
[227.76s → 234.96s] and I'm a halfling, and I'm also a warlock, and I'm really, really thrilled to be here.
[235.92s → 241.52s] You know, I've been in my home prepping and getting ready, and I'm wearing my favorite dress.
[241.52s → 247.84s] It has apples on it. I love apple pie. I brought slices for everybody just in case.
[247.84s → 253.60s] I think they're smushed in my bag right now, but I'll bring them out, and everyone can enjoy them.
[253.60s → 259.76s] And the tavern is really busy. Oh my god, I'm trying to look for my friends. Is anyone here? Oh,
[260.48s → 266.80s] I think I see Bug. I'm gonna get a glass of meat. Oh yeah. Starting off strong there.
[267.36s → 272.16s] Big glass. So as y'all are awkwardly standing and not quite interacting yet, we see someone
[272.16s → 277.28s] show up only a couple minutes late. They've got like this kind of saunter to them. Tell us a
[277.28s → 283.60s] little bit about that chance. What's up? I'm Coda. I'm an elf, like a summer elf wizard,
[284.40s → 289.28s] and I'm a blade singer. It means I'm really good with blades. This is my blade, snake's talent.
[289.28s → 296.16s] I'm still writing on a scroll, still finishing up a letter. I put my pen away and I scroll it back up,
[296.16s → 302.40s] and I look around, not as busy as I want it to be. That's okay. I saunter over to the bar.
[302.40s → 307.20s] Nice. And so y'all are waiting there a little bit awkwardly. You've worked together before,
[308.00s → 312.72s] but you're not super, super tight quite yet. There's just a little bit of familiarity of
[312.72s → 315.92s] somebody that could be picked for the same job in this mercenary group, so you're making a little
[315.92s → 321.44s] bit of eye contact here and there. And five minutes late, with not a care in the world,
[321.44s → 325.20s] you start to feel a little bit of a rumbling on the ground as though something with heavy,
[325.20s → 330.64s] weighted feet is walking up and bursting through the door. Yeah, right through the door comes an
[330.64s → 340.96s] eight-foot tall wooden robot. A druid war forged, named Furny. I come in, I burst through and I just
[340.96s → 350.72s] go, alcohol. And then saunter up to the bar and just stop there. And I'm looking for who I was
[350.72s → 356.80s] supposed to be here with, and I'm so excited. Oh my gosh. Okay. I have a book sees him. It's like
[356.80s → 362.64s] alcohol. Nice to meet you. I must be working with you. Oh, sweet alcohol. Great. We both love alcohol.
[362.64s → 369.84s] No, Furny. Oh, okay. Whoops. I wish it was alcohol. That'd be so cool. Don't get too drunk. We have a
[369.84s → 376.64s] meeting. All right. Yeah, I'll take four needs. What do you guys want? Oh, I'm just going to have
[376.64s → 385.76s] one glass of meat for four needs for the one here. I'll take a barrel of ale. Okay. You can pay for
[385.76s → 394.80s] that big fella. I've got you. I have extra coin. Yes, we can. All right. So as you're about to pay
[394.80s → 401.12s] for your meat and get your drinks, you hear a voice from all the way across the bar sitting in a
[401.12s → 406.16s] corner booth that's way too big for just them waiting for a bunch of people flagging you down.
[406.16s → 414.88s] You see this creature of large stature ripped as hell, bald head, kind of light green skin and
[414.88s → 420.32s] beard that is a little bit salt and pepper, a little bit older, a little bit braided teeth coming
[420.32s → 424.88s] up from the bottom of the mouth. As you know, they are an orc. And there's somebody that you've worked
[424.88s → 428.96s] with many times before. They're the ones who give you the job in this mercenary troupe. So they flag
[428.96s → 433.68s] you over and they're like, hey, guys, hey, hey, come on down. Hey, I got seats for all of us. Come on.
[433.68s → 439.20s] Hey. Oh, yeah. Huge booths. Yeah. Well, I was waiting for you. Yeah, I expected more people.
[440.48s → 444.88s] All right. So you guys thirsty? What is the freeest drink? Four waters, Garçon.
[444.88s → 450.00s] Four waters, please. Okay. Oh. Yeah. All right. I've got to get you all hydrated. Hey. So thank
[450.00s → 456.64s] you so much for me today. I really appreciate you all joining me again. For those of you that are
[456.64s → 462.24s] maybe a little bit hard of memory and intelligence. I'm crung-dart, the bloodsmith.
[463.60s → 468.16s] It's great to work with you again. So listen, big announcement. You may have noticed we're not at
[468.16s → 473.36s] our company headquarters anymore. We're doing a little bit of downsizing, right? Okay. There's been
[473.36s → 480.64s] some budget cuts. Yeah, you know, it's a hard time. We're doing our best to stay afloat. But
[480.64s → 485.84s] like all good things, we've got to make a little pivot here and there. Sure. So see, this guy gets it.
[485.84s → 493.92s] Yeah. I get it too. Kids. I've always gotten it. I pivot all the time. All right. I believe
[493.92s → 499.04s] that all four of you get it. That's great. I have it. It's like elbows. Oh, Ferney. You're
[499.04s → 506.32s] going to be a blast. Yeah. That's great. Yeah. You know, the thing is I know you all are used to
[506.32s → 511.52s] combat and probably really enjoy that quite a bit. But as you can see, jobs are a little scarce.
[511.52s → 516.24s] And he points over to a job listing board, where you see like a bunch of like hardened mercenaries
[516.24s → 522.00s] just sort of waiting there with arms crossed. A small like, you know, hired hand at the end, walks
[522.00s → 526.56s] up very slowly and delicately with like a piece of paper in the moment they tacked the board. They
[526.56s → 535.36s] just jump on the line. He's just like, oh, he got trampled. Yeah, he's gone. And so we've been
[535.36s → 540.08s] sourcing you guys some new jobs. So really exciting. Y'all are more than qualified.
[540.88s → 546.72s] We are no longer the banner of the unkillable spirit. We're a delivery service.
[547.84s → 556.88s] Oh, okay. So what are we delivering? Yeah. Oh, see, that's going to change all the time.
[556.88s → 561.28s] We deliver whatever needs to deliver in. You know, because people need goods and products and all
[561.28s → 566.00s] the roads are paved. They just don't have time to go get them themselves, right? So is the
[566.00s → 570.48s] pay about the same though? Oh, the pay is great. If you get there quickly and you do a good job,
[570.48s → 577.04s] you can get tipped. We of course keep our cut. Me, of course, being management. Of course.
[577.04s → 581.52s] But you know, I know you guys have only been on a few adventures with each other, you know,
[581.52s → 587.44s] at this point, but when I look at you for specifically, I know in my heart that you're the ones
[587.44s → 593.76s] who didn't quit yet. So you're right for this job. Will we know what we're delivering? Just get
[593.76s → 597.84s] a little peak. Of course. Yeah. Tell me all about it. Does that mean you're in?
[598.48s → 604.80s] Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. I've been. Yeah. Fantastic. What if we're delivering punches to people's faces?
[606.16s → 608.96s] That's kind of like what we were already doing. Honestly, I'm down. Yeah?
[609.52s → 614.64s] Oh, only if they deserve it. Sure. I don't know if this is a good time, but I've heard about you.
[614.64s → 620.40s] You're a legend. Thank you. Bugs looking up. I have to look so up. I've heard so much about you.
[620.40s → 626.56s] You too, Koda. Yeah, bug. You're the guy who got beat up by that bug, right? Yeah. Yeah.
[627.04s → 631.12s] Is that other name? That's not. No, that's it was just a coincidence. Just a coincidence?
[631.12s → 637.04s] Yeah. That's insane. That is. That is. That is. Yeah. Sure. You could say that.
[637.04s → 642.48s] Anyway, are you sure there's not a mistake that this isn't a group meant to, you know, hunt down
[642.48s → 648.00s] and attack evil demons? No, I'm absolutely positive. No, you're going to be doing normal deliveries.
[648.00s → 651.76s] Okay. So great. Everybody good with making money in a difficult economy?
[651.76s → 655.12s] Hang it on your jobs. As long as we're helping people, I mean, I think that's great.
[655.12s → 661.28s] You will be helping things. That's for sure. All right. So first delivery up is going to take
[661.28s → 666.08s] you to the Grandel marshes. That's right. If you head north along the shoreline and don't worry,
[666.08s → 672.32s] we'll provide your wagon and it's okay. We've got this and he pulls out something about pancake
[672.32s → 679.52s] size. We got this stone icon for you. There is a there's a group of people living in the forest
[679.52s → 685.92s] and they need this stone tablet very badly. You got to make sure it gets there undamaged,
[685.92s → 690.56s] right? Unscuffed. And I think if you make good time, you'll probably get a solid tip.
[690.56s → 694.80s] You know, there's new for me too, right? You know, so it seems pretty easy to take the rock to the
[694.80s → 702.56s] Grandel Galleria. Got it. Got it. I could probably. The Grandel Galleria, the Grandel Galleria.
[702.56s → 707.04s] Easy. Yeah, just take the rock. I love the Grandel Galleria. They have great sales at Checos.
[708.48s → 711.04s] And you're a woman so we could put it in your purse. Please.
[712.48s → 720.48s] Bug. Yes. My purse is enormous. It's actually half the size of me and I really carry it around my
[720.48s → 729.20s] belt and sometimes it rubs against the ground, but I don't mind. Amazing. So Krungdar hands you this
[729.20s → 734.32s] stone tablet. It's a little heavier than it looks. But it's it's weighty. It's weighty. I've got it.
[734.32s → 741.92s] All right. I've got it. Do you want to be sure? Yes. All right. So we got a we got a little guy named
[741.92s → 746.72s] Gunther outside who's getting ready to take you there. Sorry, actually when I assume he say yes
[746.80s → 750.80s] hard times, right? So unless anyone else has any more questions, I can just let you
[750.80s → 755.84s] wonder on your way. How's it going? Pretty good. Furny. Okay, sorry. I thought it was
[755.84s → 760.16s] you know. That's very kind of you. It is pretty good. I feel like it's important to ask that sometimes.
[760.96s → 766.00s] You've had two barrels of meat. I have. Okay. Oh yeah, you've been sipping on that while I've
[766.00s → 770.88s] been talking, huh? Yeah. Is that what you were doing? I was I was I was actively picking up this barrel
[770.88s → 779.68s] and hugging it. Yeah. Yeah. I just got it. And I throw it. Falling out. And I don't worry about
[779.68s → 785.12s] where it goes. Uh, you, uh, okay. So, uh, the ground below you. Just looks up and it's just like
[785.76s → 789.36s] just like blocks it with one hand. Like, this is not his first day. Like dealing with a
[789.36s → 793.60s] bar full of mercenaries. She's on cleaning his cup. Just like, Thompson puts it down. Uh,
[793.60s → 797.92s] we're just like, all right, it's just before you. Yeah, I stand up from the booth and I fix my hair again.
[797.92s → 803.76s] Oh, gorgeous. Oh my god. You guys ready? Yeah. Wow. Do you guys mind if I take shotgun? I get
[803.76s → 809.92s] car sick. Oh, definitely. I don't want to throw up in the wagon. I sometimes feel weird sitting
[809.92s → 815.20s] in a wagon because I am also made of wood. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I guess it kind of feels. Yeah.
[815.20s → 819.68s] I don't know the word for it, but it feels weird. But I'll do it. I'll do it. Yeah. I don't think
[819.68s → 824.00s] we get to choose what kind of car we go to. That's fair. Did you say in car? I don't know what
[824.08s → 827.36s] part. Cart. Cart. Cart. Cart. Cart. I'd love to drive
[828.56s → 834.72s] with gumthar. You're gonna just to make sure that I have the GPS correct. What do you. What?
[834.72s → 838.48s] The compass. Great. There you go. Um, I just want to go in the front of the cart so I don't
[838.48s → 844.56s] bark. Do you guys mind? Coda? Don't mind it all. Thanks guys. So uh, y'all step outside of the bar. Um,
[845.28s → 852.80s] and you see um, this, this pretty long sizable wagon that like while not perfectly comfortable
[852.80s → 856.84s] is big enough for a huge war forage.
[856.84s → 860.28s] A couple of little guys in a normal sized elf.
[860.28s → 863.64s] And standing in front of it is this very stern looking
[863.64s → 865.48s] centaur.
[865.48s → 866.52s] Oh, shit.
[866.52s → 867.44s] Looking around.
[867.44s → 869.44s] So attractive.
[869.44s → 872.76s] Yeah, he's got long black rippling hair,
[872.76s → 876.64s] really deep voice, a little bit stubble.
[876.64s → 877.72s] Dolores.
[877.72s → 878.40s] Dolores.
[878.40s → 879.68s] Clearly just a sh- I'm sorry.
[879.68s → 881.72s] Muscular, rippling beast.
[881.72s → 883.32s] Oh my god.
[883.32s → 887.12s] I just need a tub and to light a bunch of candles right now.
[887.12s → 889.32s] Hey, my equestrian-like friend.
[889.32s → 890.72s] Are you Gunthar?
[890.72s → 892.80s] Hey, flesh elf.
[892.80s → 893.52s] Yeah.
[893.52s → 895.00s] I'm Gunthar.
[895.00s → 896.08s] For Gunthar?
[896.08s → 896.56s] Or no?
[896.56s → 897.28s] For Koda?
[897.28s → 898.08s] This is Koda?
[898.08s → 899.08s] Yeah.
[899.08s → 900.28s] For Koda?
[900.28s → 901.28s] For Koda?
[903.28s → 904.56s] I'm sorry, are you Koda?
[904.56s → 905.08s] I'm Koda.
[905.08s → 906.72s] I'm going to need you to stop him from talking to me.
[906.72s → 908.00s] So I'm Gunthar.
[908.00s → 908.68s] I got it.
[908.68s → 911.64s] Listen, I'm going to be taking you to the grandel
[911.64s → 912.64s] marshes.
[912.64s → 913.64s] All right.
[913.64s → 915.00s] I don't want no funny business, OK?
[915.00s → 917.24s] My wagon, I want to keep this thing pristine.
[917.24s → 918.24s] Absolutely.
[918.24s → 919.24s] All right.
[919.24s → 920.24s] I got it.
[920.24s → 921.24s] Absolutely.
[921.24s → 923.12s] Can the little one sit in the front?
[923.12s → 924.72s] He wants to sit directly in the back.
[924.72s → 926.24s] He wants to sit on your hide.
[926.24s → 928.24s] Yeah, if you think you can fit.
[928.24s → 930.72s] So Gunthar does this huge whistle with his fingers
[930.72s → 932.68s] and around the band comes a horse,
[932.68s → 935.72s] which he then attaches to the front of the wagon.
[935.72s → 938.36s] He then uses his hoofs to climb in the very front
[938.36s → 940.92s] and lay like side saddle as he's about to drive.
[940.92s → 941.52s] What?
[941.52s → 944.00s] I am so confused right now.
[944.00s → 945.56s] How are we going to fit with his hoofs?
[945.56s → 947.68s] Gunthar, you took me for a ride just now, bro.
[947.68s → 948.52s] Oh, literally.
[948.52s → 949.52s] Literally.
[949.52s → 950.52s] It's true.
[950.52s → 952.20s] And I thought a wooden rope.
[952.20s → 954.44s] I thought a wooden warforge sitting in a wooden cart
[954.44s → 955.20s] was going to be weird.
[955.20s → 957.16s] This is actually weird.
[957.16s → 957.68s] I'm sorry.
[957.68s → 959.56s] Can you just pump the brakes for me for a minute there?
[959.56s → 961.48s] Can you look me in the eyes and explain why it's weird
[961.48s → 962.68s] that I would be driving the carriage?
[962.68s → 965.44s] Well, because the second half of you is a horse.
[965.44s → 969.64s] So I thought you were about to lead the boat ahead.
[969.68s → 970.20s] Lock in.
[970.20s → 971.44s] I'm going to need you to give it a shot.
[971.44s → 972.88s] Hey, hey, f**k her knee.
[972.88s → 973.72s] Yeah.
[973.72s → 975.28s] Let's just take a seat in the wagon.
[975.28s → 975.80s] OK.
[975.80s → 976.56s] What spot do you want?
[976.56s → 977.48s] What spot do you want, for any?
[977.48s → 978.40s] I'll take the back.
[978.40s → 978.92s] Perfect.
[978.92s → 979.96s] You have to take the whole back.
[979.96s → 981.28s] Yeah, the entire back.
[981.28s → 982.88s] So lay flat on my back.
[982.88s → 987.04s] So for the horse at the front, the horse at the front
[987.04s → 989.92s] is already like clearly really strong.
[989.92s → 993.64s] It's like this, this desterier, right?
[993.64s → 997.92s] That can handle the weight of a centaur sitting in a wagon.
[997.92s → 1000.28s] Yours definitely makes the wagon tip back a little bit.
[1000.28s → 1001.28s] Wow.
[1001.28s → 1002.28s] OK.
[1002.28s → 1005.68s] So the horse kind of looks back and says,
[1005.68s → 1006.76s] and you all start getting going.
[1006.76s → 1010.32s] Y'all are now embarking on this journey on the wagon.
[1010.32s → 1012.24s] And so far, it's been a little unaventful.
[1012.24s → 1014.76s] It's midday, so the sun is high in the sky.
[1014.76s → 1016.56s] You're looking around these plains.
[1016.56s → 1019.40s] And although you're not able to visibly see it,
[1019.40s → 1021.16s] you know that the ocean is still close,
[1021.16s → 1023.92s] because you are on the west coast of this continent.
[1023.92s → 1025.44s] So there's a little bit of salt in the air,
[1025.44s → 1027.48s] and the sun is hitting your face.
[1027.48s → 1029.92s] How are y'all feeling in this wagon?
[1029.92s → 1031.40s] Hey, good thought.
[1031.40s → 1033.36s] Just don't want my friends, my new co-workers,
[1033.36s → 1035.16s] to hear me back there.
[1035.16s → 1037.12s] You're there like two feet away.
[1037.12s → 1039.12s] It's like sitting there like this.
[1039.12s → 1041.60s] We can hear you, bugs!
[1041.60s → 1042.96s] But we have a private moment.
[1042.96s → 1044.40s] Bug, we can hear you.
[1044.40s → 1046.20s] Bernie, I believe in the first day of a job
[1046.20s → 1047.52s] you shouldn't show any weaknesses.
[1047.52s → 1049.08s] But I'm not just as held back here.
[1049.08s → 1052.76s] What's your mind if I could get on your lap?
[1052.76s → 1054.24s] So it's either you sitting on my lap
[1054.24s → 1056.00s] and throwing up in my wagon.
[1056.00s → 1059.84s] Go ahead and roll a D20 for me and see what your persuasions at.
[1059.84s → 1061.44s] Can't believe this is the first roll we're gonna pay.
[1061.44s → 1062.48s] Yeah, right?
[1062.48s → 1064.52s] 14 plus 4, 18.
[1064.52s → 1065.72s] 18.
[1065.72s → 1066.72s] You know what?
[1066.72s → 1068.76s] I think I got a little nook with your name on it.
[1068.76s → 1070.40s] And he sort of like rubs his side,
[1070.40s → 1073.08s] just sort of just like riffle one of his oblique muscles
[1073.08s → 1074.56s] into this perfect little cradle for you.
[1074.56s → 1076.36s] And I was gonna do a little filler.
[1077.40s → 1079.52s] Bug just lands perfectly.
[1079.52s → 1080.96s] I'm so jealous.
[1080.96s → 1083.40s] You're nestled on in there.
[1083.40s → 1085.68s] All right, and we're continuing on.
[1085.68s → 1087.24s] What are you three doing in the back?
[1087.24s → 1090.76s] I'm knitting a beautiful scarf
[1090.76s → 1093.08s] because it might be chilly to our destination
[1093.08s → 1094.96s] and I'm gonna make one for each of you.
[1094.96s → 1097.00s] And I'm me and Furny are looking out the back
[1097.00s → 1098.80s] and I'm like, Furny, what's that?
[1098.80s → 1100.60s] That is a bird.
[1100.60s → 1102.00s] Good, good job.
[1102.00s → 1102.84s] Yes.
[1102.84s → 1103.84s] Good.
[1103.84s → 1105.00s] Good.
[1105.00s → 1105.84s] Furny, what's that?
[1105.84s → 1106.68s] Oh, that's a rock.
[1106.68s → 1107.52s] Yes.
[1107.52s → 1108.36s] Yes.
[1108.36s → 1109.36s] You're doing great.
[1109.36s → 1111.08s] Oh, this is the hard one, Furny, what's that?
[1111.08s → 1111.84s] Oh my god.
[1111.84s → 1112.68s] Oh my god.
[1112.68s → 1113.68s] Oh my god.
[1113.68s → 1114.52s] Oh my god.
[1114.52s → 1115.36s] I know this.
[1115.36s → 1116.84s] It rhymes with girl.
[1116.84s → 1120.32s] Oh, oh, oh, girl.
[1120.32s → 1121.32s] That's a girl.
[1121.32s → 1123.20s] It rhymes with girl, it's a squirrel.
[1123.20s → 1124.20s] It's squirrel.
[1124.20s → 1125.20s] What about the bushy tail?
[1125.20s → 1126.60s] Oh, that's totally fair.
[1126.60s → 1127.92s] The girl in squirrel.
[1127.92s → 1129.28s] I was looking at Dolores.
[1131.56s → 1133.28s] Do you like the color yellow?
[1133.28s → 1134.12s] Yeah.
[1134.12s → 1135.16s] Yay.
[1135.16s → 1137.40s] I'm gonna make a huge scarf for you.
[1137.40s → 1139.00s] Oh, sick.
[1139.00s → 1140.12s] You get cold?
[1140.12s → 1140.96s] No.
[1140.96s → 1141.96s] Oh.
[1141.96s → 1144.16s] Okay.
[1144.16s → 1144.96s] I'll take a scarf.
[1144.96s → 1145.96s] Okay.
[1145.96s → 1146.96s] Yes.
[1146.96s → 1147.96s] Coda, of course.
[1147.96s → 1148.96s] Great.
[1148.96s → 1149.96s] You're just going to be metallic.
[1149.96s → 1150.96s] We were all in the front.
[1150.96s → 1151.96s] I am nestled in the gun bar.
[1151.96s → 1153.96s] And I'm like, first impression of me don't want.
[1153.96s → 1155.96s] I really want to make a good impression of my cohorts.
[1155.96s → 1156.96s] I get that.
[1156.96s → 1157.96s] And I don't want them to know.
[1157.96s → 1159.96s] I mean, it's hard to find acceptance.
[1159.96s → 1160.96s] It's hard to find acceptance.
[1160.96s → 1161.96s] I know.
[1161.96s → 1162.96s] And people are so weird talking about things that bother very much.
[1162.96s → 1163.96s] I know.
[1163.96s → 1164.96s] It's just the worst.
[1164.96s → 1165.96s] I know.
[1165.96s → 1166.96s] But we accept you.
[1166.96s → 1167.96s] We all hear you.
[1167.96s → 1168.96s] But we accept you.
[1168.96s → 1169.96s] All right.
[1169.96s → 1172.96s] So as we're walking along, it's maybe a little bit mid afternoon.
[1172.96s → 1175.96s] And we're making a good pace.
[1175.96s → 1178.96s] And you start to hear something from behind.
[1178.96s → 1181.96s] And to your right pulls up another carriage.
[1181.96s → 1186.96s] And there's another carriage of four adventurers.
[1186.96s → 1189.96s] All of whom you've seen before in town.
[1189.96s → 1191.96s] In glistening armor.
[1191.96s → 1193.96s] And shining weapons.
[1193.96s → 1196.96s] And jewels adorning their circuits.
[1196.96s → 1198.96s] And one of them shouts over.
[1198.96s → 1200.96s] He's like, hey.
[1201.96s → 1203.96s] Hey, where are you guys headed?
[1203.96s → 1205.96s] Yeah, we're on our way to go slay a cracking.
[1205.96s → 1207.96s] What kind of job did you guys get?
[1207.96s → 1208.96s] None of your business.
[1208.96s → 1209.96s] Yeah.
[1209.96s → 1210.96s] Wait.
[1210.96s → 1211.96s] What's that?
[1211.96s → 1212.96s] What's that bullshit out of your bag?
[1212.96s → 1213.96s] Dolores, hide your f***ing meeting.
[1213.96s → 1215.96s] A stone eye eye.
[1215.96s → 1216.96s] Okay.
[1216.96s → 1218.96s] You guys are the ones who picked up that quest.
[1218.96s → 1219.96s] I was wondering.
[1219.96s → 1220.96s] And I knew it to you.
[1220.96s → 1221.96s] I was like, who's going to get this?
[1221.96s → 1222.96s] It's the nerds.
[1222.96s → 1223.96s] Yeah, we're.
[1223.96s → 1224.96s] You don't like bullies here.
[1224.96s → 1227.96s] Hey, we're not nerds because I don't read.
[1227.96s → 1228.96s] Oh.
[1229.96s → 1230.96s] I can't read.
[1230.96s → 1232.96s] I can't read.
[1232.96s → 1233.96s] I don't read.
[1233.96s → 1235.96s] I probably could if I tried.
[1235.96s → 1236.96s] I'll teach you.
[1236.96s → 1237.96s] Okay.
[1237.96s → 1238.96s] Oh, wow.
[1238.96s → 1239.96s] I love this little moment.
[1239.96s → 1241.96s] I'm going to watch an old lady kiss a robot.
[1241.96s → 1243.96s] Psych, we're about to go slay a dragon.
[1243.96s → 1244.96s] Just kidding.
[1244.96s → 1245.96s] It's a crack and f*** you guys.
[1245.96s → 1247.96s] And then they just high five.
[1247.96s → 1248.96s] And right off.
[1248.96s → 1250.96s] Dolores, this is the human.
[1250.96s → 1251.96s] Yeah.
[1251.96s → 1253.96s] You guys just ignore them.
[1253.96s → 1254.96s] Honestly, they're not worth it.
[1254.96s → 1255.96s] They're insecure.
[1255.96s → 1256.96s] He called me old.
[1256.96s → 1258.96s] Well, Dolores.
[1258.96s → 1259.96s] What?
[1259.96s → 1261.96s] The age is just a number.
[1261.96s → 1262.96s] Thank you.
[1262.96s → 1264.96s] I don't even know how old I am.
[1264.96s → 1266.96s] I think you're a thousand years old.
[1266.96s → 1267.96s] Maybe.
[1267.96s → 1269.96s] Well, we'll have to count your rings.
[1269.96s → 1271.96s] Oh.
[1271.96s → 1273.96s] Ooh, that'd be cool.
[1273.96s → 1274.96s] Yeah, one day.
[1274.96s → 1275.96s] Yeah.
[1275.96s → 1276.96s] You'll show me.
[1276.96s → 1277.96s] When I'm in a museum.
[1277.96s → 1279.96s] Oh, you know what that is?
[1279.96s → 1280.96s] Yeah.
[1280.96s → 1281.96s] What is it?
[1281.96s → 1282.96s] What do you think a museum is?
[1282.96s → 1285.96s] That's a place where they have
[1285.96s → 1288.96s] paintings and stuff.
[1288.96s → 1289.96s] Yeah.
[1289.96s → 1290.96s] And other things.
[1290.96s → 1291.96s] Crazy.
[1291.96s → 1292.96s] You didn't know what a squirrel was.
[1292.96s → 1294.96s] I knew what a squirrel is.
[1294.96s → 1296.96s] I just didn't know where he was pointing.
[1296.96s → 1298.96s] Oh, it's your vision.
[1298.96s → 1300.96s] And I can't rhyme.
[1300.96s → 1301.96s] No.
[1301.96s → 1302.96s] I love that.
[1302.96s → 1303.96s] I love that.
[1303.96s → 1305.96s] I don't want to be fair.
[1305.96s → 1307.96s] Squirrel and girl is a bit of a stretch.
[1307.96s → 1308.96s] Squirrel's got the two syllables.
[1308.96s → 1309.96s] I was going to say this thing.
[1309.96s → 1310.96s] Yeah.
[1310.96s → 1311.96s] Really?
[1311.96s → 1312.96s] I say squirrel.
[1312.96s → 1313.96s] Squirrel.
[1313.96s → 1314.96s] Squirrel.
[1314.96s → 1315.96s] Squirrel.
[1315.96s → 1316.96s] Squirrel.
[1316.96s → 1317.96s] Squirrel.
[1317.96s → 1318.96s] Squirrel.
[1318.96s → 1319.96s] Squirrel.
[1319.96s → 1320.96s] Squirrel.
[1320.96s → 1321.96s] He's working on it.
[1321.96s → 1323.96s] See, that's tough for me because a squirrel looks nothing
[1323.96s → 1324.96s] like a girl.
[1324.96s → 1325.96s] But I guess there's some squirrels that aren't.
[1325.96s → 1326.96s] So it's tough.
[1326.96s → 1329.96s] So do you think rhyming means they look alike?
[1329.96s → 1330.96s] Yeah.
[1330.96s → 1331.96s] What is that?
[1331.96s → 1333.96s] I have no idea what's going on.
[1333.96s → 1334.96s] Yeah.
[1334.96s → 1338.96s] And I am scared, suddenly.
[1338.96s → 1340.96s] It's getting to be a little bit later.
[1340.96s → 1343.96s] The sun is not quite going down yet,
[1343.96s → 1345.96s] but you can tell you've got a couple more hours to get to your destination.
[1345.96s → 1347.96s] But you've made fantastic time.
[1347.96s → 1349.96s] You didn't let those jerks slow you down.
[1349.96s → 1351.96s] There were no bumps in the road.
[1351.96s → 1352.96s] Anything like that.
[1352.96s → 1353.96s] And you kept it cool.
[1353.96s → 1355.96s] So now you're making it there on time.
[1355.96s → 1358.96s] The smell of seawater starts to get a little bit stronger.
[1358.96s → 1360.96s] And you realize this isn't just a marsh.
[1360.96s → 1362.96s] You had it to a maritime forest,
[1362.96s → 1367.96s] where lush vegetation meets with ocean to make a very specifically
[1367.96s → 1370.96s] rich environment full of life.
[1370.96s → 1371.96s] Like a bog?
[1371.96s → 1373.96s] Or a marsh?
[1373.96s → 1374.96s] Yeah.
[1374.96s → 1376.96s] Well, it's a maritime forest.
[1376.96s → 1377.96s] That's like a marsh.
[1377.96s → 1378.96s] Like a marine layer?
[1378.96s → 1379.96s] Yeah, kind of.
[1379.96s → 1381.96s] Gunther stops for a moment.
[1381.96s → 1384.96s] He's like, hey guys, I'm going to need a couple of minutes here.
[1384.96s → 1387.96s] I personally am fine walking in this kind of environment,
[1387.96s → 1390.96s] but a wagon needs some specific wheels.
[1390.96s → 1391.96s] Give me about five minutes.
[1391.96s → 1392.96s] I'll pop those puppies off,
[1392.96s → 1394.96s] and we'll get this thing going all right.
[1394.96s → 1396.96s] Oh my god.
[1396.96s → 1398.96s] You clearly?
[1398.96s → 1401.96s] If you need help popping off anything,
[1401.96s → 1402.96s] I will help.
[1402.96s → 1404.96s] I have needles in my bag,
[1404.96s → 1407.96s] and I can pop off a tire like nobody's been there.
[1407.96s → 1408.96s] Jesus, Dolores.
[1408.96s → 1409.96s] That's very exciting.
[1409.96s → 1411.96s] He's like, yeah, I'm going to sit.
[1411.96s → 1413.96s] Thank you.
[1413.96s → 1415.96s] Furny would absolutely get distracted
[1415.96s → 1417.96s] and start walking off into the forest.
[1417.96s → 1418.96s] Okay.
[1418.96s → 1420.96s] Hey, hey, sit down there.
[1420.96s → 1423.96s] Sorry, I thought I just seeing nature.
[1423.96s → 1424.96s] I just, I get inspired,
[1424.96s → 1427.96s] and I just, I haven't been in a maritime forest in so long.
[1427.96s → 1428.96s] I don't even know what it is.
[1428.96s → 1429.96s] Green layer.
[1429.96s → 1430.96s] Nah.
[1430.96s → 1432.96s] Oh my goodness.
[1432.96s → 1433.96s] Incredible.
[1433.96s → 1434.96s] Same.
[1434.96s → 1436.96s] So you start to walk into the forest,
[1436.96s → 1437.96s] and the air gets a little bit,
[1437.96s → 1438.96s] is everyone else following him, too?
[1438.96s → 1439.96s] Yeah.
[1439.96s → 1440.96s] Oh, of course.
[1440.96s → 1441.96s] Okay.
[1441.96s → 1442.96s] I want to make sure Furny doesn't fall off a cliff already.
[1442.96s → 1443.96s] I'm not paying attention.
[1443.96s → 1444.96s] I'm writing.
[1444.96s → 1445.96s] Gunfire shows after he's like,
[1445.96s → 1447.96s] yeah, I guess I'll catch up.
[1447.96s → 1449.96s] All right, so.
[1449.96s → 1453.96s] You all start to walk into the forest,
[1453.96s → 1456.96s] and the air starts to get a little bit thicker
[1456.96s → 1457.96s] and heavier.
[1457.96s → 1458.96s] It's really humid.
[1458.96s → 1461.96s] Even at night, you're starting to realize how warm it is here,
[1461.96s → 1463.96s] and the vegetation is lush.
[1463.96s → 1466.96s] But thankfully, you can tell that there's a very specific,
[1466.96s → 1468.96s] you know, dirt path to follow.
[1468.96s → 1470.96s] And as you're walking along,
[1470.96s → 1471.96s] you start to notice,
[1471.96s → 1479.96s] can everybody just give me a quick roll of the D24 perception?
[1479.96s → 1481.96s] Four plus two is six.
[1481.96s → 1482.96s] Not one.
[1482.96s → 1483.96s] Holy shit.
[1483.96s → 1484.96s] Eleven.
[1484.96s → 1485.96s] All right, great.
[1485.96s → 1487.96s] So that's a two.
[1487.96s → 1488.96s] What did you get? 11?
[1488.96s → 1489.96s] 11.
[1489.96s → 1490.96s] Yeah, but not one is a critical fail.
[1490.96s → 1491.96s] So usually that counts as critical fail.
[1491.96s → 1492.96s] You're just f***ing.
[1492.96s → 1493.96s] So Furny.
[1493.96s → 1496.96s] So Deloris.
[1496.96s → 1497.96s] Yes.
[1497.96s → 1502.96s] Deloris, you walking along as someone who is a warlock.
[1502.96s → 1505.96s] And very attuned with magic of all kinds.
[1505.96s → 1509.96s] You start to feel a very familiar presence.
[1509.96s → 1512.96s] You know that you're not alone here.
[1512.96s → 1514.96s] And you start to look around,
[1514.96s → 1516.96s] and you see a couple of eyes staring at you.
[1516.96s → 1521.96s] And a couple of the trees are moving in a way counter to the wind.
[1521.96s → 1523.96s] That tree just went left.
[1523.96s → 1524.96s] What do you mean that's it?
[1524.96s → 1525.96s] Did anyone see that?
[1525.96s → 1526.96s] I didn't see.
[1526.96s → 1527.96s] What do you mean anything?
[1527.96s → 1529.96s] Furny is facing down in the mud.
[1529.96s → 1530.96s] Furny?
[1530.96s → 1532.96s] Just like bubbles coming up from.
[1532.96s → 1533.96s] Furny?
[1533.96s → 1534.96s] Oh!
[1534.96s → 1535.96s] Furny.
[1535.96s → 1537.96s] Bucks try so hard to help.
[1537.96s → 1538.96s] Furny up.
[1538.96s → 1539.96s] Oh my god.
[1539.96s → 1541.96s] Furny, what are you doing?
[1541.96s → 1542.96s] Oh my god.
[1542.96s → 1543.96s] I was swimming.
[1543.96s → 1544.96s] What?
[1544.96s → 1546.96s] You have to be fully emerged.
[1546.96s → 1549.96s] Oh god, we need to get a read.
[1549.96s → 1552.96s] So in all this commotion,
[1552.96s → 1554.96s] because Deloris is now trying to help you,
[1554.96s → 1558.96s] you don't notice that there are several things around you.
[1558.96s → 1560.96s] Please roll for initiative.
[1560.96s → 1561.96s] Oh, shit.
[1561.96s → 1562.96s] All of us?
[1562.96s → 1563.96s] Yep.
[1563.96s → 1565.96s] If I roll another one, I swear to god.
[1565.96s → 1566.96s] 11.
[1566.96s → 1567.96s] Oh, good.
[1567.96s → 1568.96s] I got a three.
[1568.96s → 1569.96s] Plus one.
[1569.96s → 1570.96s] 11, 16, 14.
[1570.96s → 1571.96s] All right, so let's see.
[1571.96s → 1572.96s] You got 14.
[1572.96s → 1573.96s] Yeah.
[1573.96s → 1574.96s] Deloris is 16.
[1574.96s → 1575.96s] 16.
[1575.96s → 1576.96s] You got 11.
[1576.96s → 1577.96s] Me at six.
[1577.96s → 1578.96s] You got six.
[1578.96s → 1580.96s] You got four.
[1580.96s → 1581.96s] Four.
[1581.96s → 1582.96s] Thank god I'm here.
[1582.96s → 1583.96s] Out of roll initiative for these things.
[1583.96s → 1584.96s] I know.
[1584.96s → 1585.96s] The first thing is up.
[1585.96s → 1587.96s] The tree, Deloris, that you noticed,
[1587.96s → 1589.96s] stops moving in the way that it does,
[1589.96s → 1594.96s] and one specific branch just sort of swings off of its lever
[1594.96s → 1597.96s] and falls off, and it runs right up to you
[1597.96s → 1599.96s] and tries to scratch you.
[1599.96s → 1600.96s] What do you mean?
[1600.96s → 1601.96s] The tree does?
[1601.96s → 1602.96s] It looks like a twig.
[1602.96s → 1603.96s] It looks like a twig.
[1603.96s → 1604.96s] It's very small, but it runs up to you.
[1604.96s → 1605.96s] It's a hand.
[1605.96s → 1607.96s] Scorries across the ground and just scratches at you.
[1607.96s → 1608.96s] All right.
[1608.96s → 1610.96s] So let's see if it hits here.
[1610.96s → 1612.96s] That is a net 20.
[1612.96s → 1614.96s] So it definitely hits.
[1614.96s → 1619.96s] The damage is two.
[1619.96s → 1621.96s] So we're going to say that's a four.
[1621.96s → 1622.96s] It does four damage to you.
[1622.96s → 1623.96s] Okay.
[1623.96s → 1626.96s] I don't understand why people can be so many.
[1626.96s → 1628.96s] You're just saying that is this thing?
[1628.96s → 1631.96s] I don't understand why people can be so mean.
[1631.96s → 1632.96s] Ow!
[1632.96s → 1633.96s] It's not my braids!
[1633.96s → 1635.96s] Don't undo my braids!
[1635.96s → 1639.96s] Next up, Deloris, you, it is your turn.
[1639.96s → 1644.96s] I would like to take my dagger and just start stabbing it.
[1644.96s → 1645.96s] All right.
[1645.96s → 1647.96s] I would like to cut it off at the wrist.
[1647.96s → 1649.96s] Motherf**k.
[1649.96s → 1650.96s] No one f**ked with my hair.
[1650.96s → 1651.96s] 15.
[1651.96s → 1654.96s] So to 15, a 15 does hit.
[1655.96s → 1656.96s] Four plus two.
[1656.96s → 1657.96s] So that's six damage.
[1657.96s → 1658.96s] That's fantastic.
[1658.96s → 1659.96s] Ha!
[1659.96s → 1662.96s] So you hit and you kill this thing.
[1662.96s → 1663.96s] What does that look like to you?
[1663.96s → 1667.96s] So I take this dagger and I stab it clean right at the wrist.
[1667.96s → 1672.96s] So you hit that thing cleanly and it falls to the ground in little splinters and stays there.
[1672.96s → 1673.96s] Fantastic.
[1673.96s → 1676.96s] So that one is dead already.
[1676.96s → 1677.96s] Next.
[1677.96s → 1678.96s] Pick up one of the splinters.
[1678.96s → 1682.96s] You have a bonus action so you could just pick it up and keep it on you if you wanted to.
[1683.96s → 1684.96s] You have time to do that.
[1684.96s → 1685.96s] You just want to hold on to it.
[1685.96s → 1686.96s] I want to hold on to it.
[1686.96s → 1687.96s] Maybe research it later.
[1687.96s → 1688.96s] Okay.
[1688.96s → 1689.96s] That's a great idea.
[1689.96s → 1691.96s] So another one of these branches, seeing that this has happened,
[1691.96s → 1695.96s] scurries down off the tree and avoids you because it knows you are trouble.
[1695.96s → 1700.96s] And it scurries up the leg of Coda and attempts to make an attack with its claws once again.
[1700.96s → 1702.96s] That is a, does a 16 hit?
[1702.96s → 1703.96s] Yeah.
[1703.96s → 1707.96s] So it is going to do,
[1708.96s → 1711.96s] it is going to do two damage to you piercing.
[1711.96s → 1713.96s] So it's a little twig hands.
[1713.96s → 1716.96s] It just sort of goes E into your arm and your upper right shoulder.
[1716.96s → 1719.96s] Thankfully Coda, it is also your turn next.
[1719.96s → 1722.96s] I'm just going to use shocking grass on this little f***er.
[1722.96s → 1723.96s] Amazing.
[1723.96s → 1724.96s] Hold on.
[1724.96s → 1725.96s] Good luck.
[1725.96s → 1726.96s] Thanks.
[1726.96s → 1727.96s] Your heroes work.
[1727.96s → 1728.96s] Eight plus five.
[1728.96s → 1729.96s] Plus five.
[1729.96s → 1730.96s] 13.
[1730.96s → 1731.96s] 13.
[1731.96s → 1733.96s] 13 does hit.
[1733.96s → 1734.96s] Hell yeah.
[1734.96s → 1736.96s] So roll for damage.
[1740.96s → 1741.96s] Four.
[1741.96s → 1743.96s] Your shocking grass does kill this thing.
[1743.96s → 1745.96s] Describe to us what shocking grass looks like to you.
[1745.96s → 1746.96s] Yeah.
[1746.96s → 1749.96s] I just take my f***ing hands and I grab that twig and I'm like,
[1751.96s → 1752.96s] clear?
[1752.96s → 1755.96s] It lets out this horrid little screen as it crumbles to the ground.
[1755.96s → 1760.96s] The two pairs of eyes from behind the trees emerge and become a little bit more visible in view.
[1761.96s → 1763.96s] Ooh, and I say, for my bonus action, I say,
[1763.96s → 1765.96s] you look shocked to see me.
[1765.96s → 1767.96s] Oh, very good.
[1767.96s → 1772.96s] The two pairs of eyes turn to look at each other and look back to you.
[1772.96s → 1774.96s] Does anyone here speak Sylvan?
[1774.96s → 1775.96s] I do.
[1775.96s → 1776.96s] All right.
[1776.96s → 1779.96s] So one of them turns and you can tell what they're saying.
[1779.96s → 1782.96s] They point directly at you when they're like,
[1782.96s → 1789.96s] you, you, me, you.
[1789.96s → 1794.96s] One of them rushes at you with an extreme fervor and anger.
[1794.96s → 1796.96s] Does he say this in Sylvan?
[1796.96s → 1797.96s] Does he say this in common?
[1797.96s → 1799.96s] He's saying it in common in response to their Sylvan.
[1799.96s → 1800.96s] So you all don't know Sylvan.
[1800.96s → 1802.96s] So you're hearing him, hear Sylvan and go,
[1802.96s → 1803.96s] actually, do you know Sylvan?
[1803.96s → 1804.96s] For...
[1804.96s → 1805.96s] You're in a live room.
[1805.96s → 1806.96s] You should.
[1806.96s → 1807.96s] I don't.
[1807.96s → 1810.96s] I get to choose one of my choosing, but I'm not choosing.
[1810.96s → 1811.96s] Okay.
[1811.96s → 1812.96s] Got it.
[1812.96s → 1814.96s] Is Hermione's head out of the puddle yet?
[1814.96s → 1815.96s] Yeah.
[1815.96s → 1816.96s] Fernie has stood up.
[1816.96s → 1817.96s] Oh, my God.
[1817.96s → 1819.96s] Fernie, what are you here?
[1819.96s → 1823.96s] He's saying you to me.
[1823.96s → 1825.96s] So he's saying you to you.
[1825.96s → 1826.96s] Yes.
[1826.96s → 1829.96s] Do you think by the way he's delivering it, he means...
[1829.96s → 1830.96s] Is it a good you?
[1830.96s → 1832.96s] He definitely means to say what he's saying.
[1832.96s → 1834.96s] No, no, not I think he means it.
[1834.96s → 1836.96s] But what is the emotion behind it?
[1836.96s → 1837.96s] Yeah, what's the emotion?
[1837.96s → 1838.96s] I know you're a wood.
[1838.96s → 1839.96s] He's pissed.
[1839.96s → 1840.96s] Oh, my God.
[1840.96s → 1842.96s] Good context clues.
[1842.96s → 1843.96s] But maybe it's self-hatred.
[1843.96s → 1844.96s] Oh.
[1844.96s → 1845.96s] Well, that's good.
[1845.96s → 1848.96s] Yeah, it's made of wood and I made of wood.
[1848.96s → 1850.96s] Maybe he sees himself in me.
[1850.96s → 1853.96s] So while you're explaining this, this thing rushes up to you.
[1853.96s → 1858.96s] When these eyes emerge, Fernie, you recognize these
[1858.96s → 1861.96s] since you were a dweller of the forest as dryheads.
[1861.96s → 1865.96s] They are these almost feminine forms that are leaf spirits
[1865.96s → 1868.96s] and very much tied to the world of the fey,
[1868.96s → 1870.96s] which is fairytum.
[1870.96s → 1873.96s] They see you and they are absolutely pissed
[1873.96s → 1875.96s] and they speak in the language of fairies.
[1875.96s → 1878.96s] So using the wrath of the forest,
[1878.96s → 1882.96s] they reach into their own arms and turn them into a club
[1882.96s → 1884.96s] instead of a bunch of twigs and leaves.
[1884.96s → 1887.96s] One of them rears back to hit you and it rolls.
[1887.96s → 1889.96s] 20 is probably gonna hit, right?
[1889.96s → 1890.96s] Yeah.
[1890.96s → 1891.96s] Okay.
[1891.96s → 1894.96s] That is going to do a fair amount of damage to you.
[1894.96s → 1895.96s] That is going to do...
[1895.96s → 1897.96s] You are absolutely lucky.
[1897.96s → 1898.96s] It does five damage to you.
[1898.96s → 1899.96s] It's okay.
[1899.96s → 1900.96s] Good job, Fernie.
[1900.96s → 1901.96s] Amazing.
[1901.96s → 1904.96s] I'm just like, hi, Turk!
[1904.96s → 1907.96s] Next up, that second dryhead emerges
[1907.96s → 1909.96s] and starts yelling something as well.
[1909.96s → 1911.96s] But your head is so rattled right now.
[1911.96s → 1913.96s] You can't really understand what it's saying.
[1913.96s → 1916.96s] It is casting a fey charm on you.
[1916.96s → 1920.96s] So you have to give me a wisdom saving throw.
[1920.96s → 1921.96s] Five.
[1921.96s → 1924.96s] Okay, so unfortunately, that does not succeed for you.
[1924.96s → 1929.96s] So you start to feel yourself feel a little bit better
[1929.96s → 1933.96s] and you recognize this dryhead is not an enemy.
[1933.96s → 1935.96s] But a friend.
[1935.96s → 1938.96s] In fact, it's something you want it here.
[1938.96s → 1940.96s] And it's here to help you.
[1940.96s → 1941.96s] Yes.
[1941.96s → 1945.96s] And you really want to make sure this thing is as safe as possible.
[1945.96s → 1949.96s] So you can communicate that to your friends if you want.
[1949.96s → 1951.96s] But this is how you are feeling.
[1952.96s → 1955.96s] Everyone, this is my best friend.
[1955.96s → 1958.96s] Fernie, my dude, that thing just hit you.
[1958.96s → 1960.96s] No, no, they're my best friend.
[1960.96s → 1961.96s] Don't befriend your bullies.
[1961.96s → 1962.96s] They're my best friend.
[1962.96s → 1964.96s] Fernie, look at how they're looking at you.
[1964.96s → 1966.96s] You don't get to choose your friends.
[1966.96s → 1967.96s] Never trust a woman.
[1967.96s → 1968.96s] You do.
[1968.96s → 1971.96s] You can choose your family, but you can't choose your friends.
[1971.96s → 1974.96s] Why are you almost correct to do so?
[1974.96s → 1977.96s] He's like, no.
[1977.96s → 1978.96s] Oh, Fernie.
[1978.96s → 1979.96s] No.
[1980.96s → 1981.96s] Oh, God.
[1981.96s → 1984.96s] Basically, you are now charmed by this creature.
[1984.96s → 1985.96s] And not in a full sense.
[1985.96s → 1987.96s] You're not entirely under its control.
[1987.96s → 1990.96s] But to the best of your ability, you do need to take its requests.
[1990.96s → 1991.96s] Okay.
[1991.96s → 1995.96s] So it says to you in Sylvan, I need your protection.
[1995.96s → 1996.96s] Okay.
[1996.96s → 1998.96s] Next up, we have Bug.
[1998.96s → 2000.96s] Did any of them come at me?
[2000.96s → 2001.96s] None of them come at you.
[2001.96s → 2003.96s] They've only been going for him for whatever reason.
[2003.96s → 2004.96s] But there are two dryheads.
[2004.96s → 2005.96s] And that's all you can see from us.
[2005.96s → 2006.96s] Okay.
[2006.96s → 2007.96s] You should be good.
[2007.96s → 2009.96s] Do you need protection?
[2009.96s → 2011.96s] She needs protection.
[2011.96s → 2012.96s] I'm not going to protect her.
[2012.96s → 2013.96s] She's hitting you on your right hand.
[2013.96s → 2014.96s] I don't know.
[2014.96s → 2015.96s] I don't know.
[2015.96s → 2016.96s] She said she needs protection.
[2016.96s → 2017.96s] I don't know from who.
[2017.96s → 2018.96s] Fernie, can you ask?
[2018.96s → 2019.96s] Who do you need protection from?
[2019.96s → 2020.96s] What do you need protection from?
[2020.96s → 2021.96s] What kind of protection do you need?
[2021.96s → 2023.96s] You killed two of us.
[2023.96s → 2025.96s] You've killed more of us.
[2025.96s → 2026.96s] Holy shit.
[2026.96s → 2027.96s] What did she say?
[2027.96s → 2029.96s] She says I've killed a lot of them.
[2029.96s → 2030.96s] Tell them.
[2030.96s → 2031.96s] She omitted my braids.
[2031.96s → 2033.96s] Yeah, to be fair, they attacked us first.
[2033.96s → 2034.96s] That is true.
[2034.96s → 2035.96s] That is true.
[2035.96s → 2036.96s] Oh, it's by fact.
[2036.96s → 2037.96s] What are you doing?
[2037.96s → 2039.96s] All right, Bug is like this is the time, Bug.
[2039.96s → 2042.96s] This is where you show everyone around you.
[2042.96s → 2043.96s] Bug.
[2043.96s → 2044.96s] You're stuck.
[2044.96s → 2045.96s] You've got to get to work here.
[2045.96s → 2051.96s] So I'm going to fucking attack this woman with my crossbro.
[2051.96s → 2053.96s] Okay, do you want to attack the one that hit him
[2053.96s → 2055.96s] or attack the one that was whispering to him?
[2055.96s → 2057.96s] The one that was whispering to my friend.
[2057.96s → 2058.96s] Great.
[2058.96s → 2061.96s] So go ahead and roll your crossbow to see if it hits.
[2061.96s → 2062.96s] Roll at D20.
[2062.96s → 2063.96s] Yep.
[2063.96s → 2064.96s] Plus two.
[2065.96s → 2067.96s] Okay, so that is a nat one.
[2067.96s → 2073.96s] So you lock in your crossbow bolt and come on.
[2073.96s → 2075.96s] It's a little bit off of the track.
[2075.96s → 2079.96s] And when you fire the string just makes it like flip and like land
[2079.96s → 2081.96s] at the tip of your shoe, not where your toe is.
[2081.96s → 2084.96s] Just like kind of pinning that shoe to the ground for a minute.
[2084.96s → 2087.96s] So you're kind of you're stuck a little bit there.
[2087.96s → 2089.96s] Oh, it gets me stuck to the ground.
[2089.96s → 2090.96s] Yeah, you're a little bit stuck.
[2090.96s → 2091.96s] It's a bug bug.
[2091.96s → 2092.96s] It's okay, bug.
[2092.96s → 2093.96s] You fucked this up.
[2093.96s → 2095.96s] But we can hear you, honey.
[2095.96s → 2097.96s] Okay, okay, this does this some time.
[2097.96s → 2100.96s] No, it's nothing to do bad about one in five goblins
[2100.96s → 2102.96s] have executionally here.
[2102.96s → 2105.96s] Hey, Koda, it's a new crossbow.
[2105.96s → 2107.96s] Oh, I totally get that.
[2107.96s → 2108.96s] So don't worry.
[2108.96s → 2112.96s] Should you keep the receipt or return it?
[2112.96s → 2113.96s] Yeah.
[2113.96s → 2114.96s] Return it.
[2114.96s → 2115.96s] Pack it up.
[2115.96s → 2116.96s] They don't even care if you use it before.
[2116.96s → 2117.96s] Yeah, I don't care.
[2117.96s → 2118.96s] Please be.
[2118.96s → 2119.96s] I've returned a lot.
[2119.96s → 2120.96s] I want to rip my foot off of it.
[2120.96s → 2121.96s] Yeah, we can say it's your bonus action.
[2121.96s → 2122.96s] You're able to pull it out.
[2122.96s → 2123.96s] But then that's your whole turn.
[2123.96s → 2124.96s] Okay.
[2124.96s → 2127.96s] Stop looking at me, guys.
[2127.96s → 2129.96s] Finally up is Ferny.
[2129.96s → 2134.96s] Now, Ferny, you are still able to act under your will for the most part,
[2134.96s → 2137.96s] but you have to follow the order of protect her.
[2137.96s → 2139.96s] So whatever that means to you, you are charmed.
[2139.96s → 2141.96s] You have to do that to the best of your ability.
[2141.96s → 2142.96s] She said to protect her.
[2142.96s → 2146.96s] I'll protect you from your friend who just hit me.
[2146.96s → 2147.96s] She seems crazy.
[2147.96s → 2148.96s] Nice.
[2148.96s → 2150.96s] You're going to be a good boyfriend.
[2150.96s → 2151.96s] You got it.
[2151.96s → 2154.96s] We got to stop your friend.
[2154.96s → 2157.96s] So what do you do in that moment before she can correct you with your stupidity?
[2157.96s → 2164.96s] I just immediately, my hand goes into my forearm and then a hand axe.
[2164.96s → 2166.96s] Thing pops out of the forearm.
[2166.96s → 2167.96s] Hell yeah.
[2167.96s → 2170.96s] And I'm just like, I'll protect you and then I go straight for her.
[2170.96s → 2171.96s] Nice.
[2171.96s → 2173.96s] Are you doing that as primal savagery or like a normal hand axe?
[2173.96s → 2175.96s] Just normal hand axe attack.
[2175.96s → 2177.96s] You're standard hand axe.
[2177.96s → 2179.96s] Go ahead and roll your D20.
[2179.96s → 2181.96s] Please for the love of God, Furny.
[2181.96s → 2182.96s] 11.
[2182.96s → 2183.96s] Plus 1.
[2183.96s → 2184.96s] Plus 1.
[2184.96s → 2185.96s] That does hit.
[2185.96s → 2186.96s] So go ahead and roll your damage.
[2186.96s → 2191.96s] So that's a D6, which is normal dice like that you use for that.
[2191.96s → 2192.96s] Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2192.96s → 2193.96s] Okay, yeah.
[2193.96s → 2194.96s] All right.
[2194.96s → 2196.96s] That's a 4 plus 1.
[2196.96s → 2197.96s] Amazing.
[2197.96s → 2199.96s] So this thing takes 5 damage.
[2199.96s → 2200.96s] Sick, Furny.
[2200.96s → 2201.96s] Good job, Furny.
[2201.96s → 2202.96s] Yeah.
[2202.96s → 2203.96s] Fantastic.
[2203.96s → 2205.96s] And so now you have your bonus action.
[2205.96s → 2206.96s] Yeah, yeah.
[2206.96s → 2210.96s] And I think I do the one swing and then I like my other hand also turns into a hand axe
[2210.96s → 2212.96s] and I'm going to go for a second swing.
[2212.96s → 2213.96s] Nice.
[2213.96s → 2214.96s] So roll the hit.
[2214.96s → 2216.96s] Let's see.
[2216.96s → 2217.96s] That's a 7.
[2217.96s → 2221.96s] So unfortunately, that one does like with entirely.
[2221.96s → 2222.96s] Oh.
[2222.96s → 2225.96s] Next up, Dolores, seeing that this is a miss, you've got to step in and fix this.
[2225.96s → 2226.96s] It's your turn.
[2226.96s → 2232.96s] Well, I'm getting very tired of these sassy women hurting my friends.
[2232.96s → 2238.96s] So I have decided to start cooking up an eldrige blast.
[2238.96s → 2239.96s] Love it.
[2239.96s → 2242.96s] And are you going to be attacking the one that hit him with a stick or the one that is like still whispering?
[2242.96s → 2246.96s] I am tired of that woman whispering nasty little things in your ear.
[2246.96s → 2247.96s] Okay.
[2247.96s → 2248.96s] I have to protect her.
[2248.96s → 2249.96s] Oh, Furny.
[2249.96s → 2250.96s] She's toxic.
[2250.96s → 2255.96s] Oh, you're like one of those guys against like a spell when women talk to him.
[2255.96s → 2256.96s] Yeah.
[2256.96s → 2258.96s] So go ahead and roll to see if that eldrige blast hits.
[2258.96s → 2259.96s] All right.
[2259.96s → 2261.96s] Come on, baby.
[2261.96s → 2263.96s] Protect my babies.
[2263.96s → 2264.96s] Two.
[2264.96s → 2265.96s] Okay.
[2265.96s → 2266.96s] So.
[2266.96s → 2267.96s] Plus five.
[2267.96s → 2268.96s] That's a seven.
[2268.96s → 2273.96s] Do you guys think this is why we're delivering stuff?
[2273.96s → 2279.96s] Do you guys think maybe we're delivering things because none of us can hit anything?
[2279.96s → 2280.96s] Yeah.
[2280.96s → 2285.96s] When my foot got stapled to the ground, I remembered those bullies in the other cart.
[2285.96s → 2287.96s] And I was like, maybe they were right.
[2287.96s → 2288.96s] Yeah.
[2288.96s → 2289.96s] I grabbed this fuzzy little ball.
[2289.96s → 2290.96s] It's so cute.
[2290.96s → 2291.96s] I don't really want to give it up.
[2291.96s → 2293.96s] But I go, hey, honey, catch.
[2293.96s → 2295.96s] And I toss it her way.
[2295.96s → 2298.96s] So she just is like staring at you like while whispering.
[2298.96s → 2299.96s] And I'm like, no, no, no, no, no.
[2299.96s → 2303.96s] And just like it's sort of like dead eyes you as it goes and just passed her hand.
[2303.96s → 2304.96s] Oh.
[2304.96s → 2310.96s] So this the one that used its arm as a club turns to you, Dolores.
[2310.96s → 2315.96s] And holds on up to you somehow gracefully but also with weight behind it.
[2315.96s → 2318.96s] And also rears back to give you a smack.
[2318.96s → 2321.96s] This is the first time they've attacked any of you because they are frustrated.
[2321.96s → 2322.96s] They are frustrated here.
[2322.96s → 2324.96s] Come at me, bitch.
[2324.96s → 2327.96s] And it does how much damage.
[2327.96s → 2328.96s] Oh no.
[2328.96s → 2329.96s] Ow.
[2329.96s → 2330.96s] It does.
[2330.96s → 2332.96s] Oh no.
[2332.96s → 2335.96s] Oh no, it does nine damage to you.
[2335.96s → 2336.96s] Jesus Christ.
[2336.96s → 2338.96s] Cause I don't have my braids in.
[2338.96s → 2339.96s] Bitch, check out my braids.
[2339.96s → 2343.96s] So this thing walks up to you and it took a lead from the top.
[2343.96s → 2344.96s] Like smacks you.
[2344.96s → 2346.96s] Where your braids would have padded you.
[2346.96s → 2348.96s] It just conquers you right on top of you.
[2348.96s → 2351.96s] You take nine damage, bringing you down to a total of eight health.
[2351.96s → 2352.96s] Whoa.
[2352.96s → 2354.96s] So Dolores is not looking so good right now.
[2354.96s → 2355.96s] Yeah.
[2355.96s → 2357.96s] You still got two dryads to deal with.
[2357.96s → 2360.96s] So next up we have Coda.
[2360.96s → 2364.96s] I see that tree knock the braid out of her hair.
[2364.96s → 2366.96s] And I'm like, oh, this is getting serious.
[2366.96s → 2368.96s] And I draw my sword snake's talent.
[2368.96s → 2369.96s] Shing.
[2369.96s → 2370.96s] Beautiful.
[2370.96s → 2372.96s] And I cast blade song.
[2372.96s → 2376.96s] Which for everyone happening, when I'm so good with a sword,
[2376.96s → 2379.96s] that it's almost like I'm singing and dancing when I start fighting.
[2379.96s → 2380.96s] A sword just.
[2380.96s → 2387.96s] So I'm like, uh, don't, don't trust the creepy wood and tree girl.
[2387.96s → 2391.96s] Don't trust the creepy wood and tree girl.
[2391.96s → 2394.96s] And I go to attack it with my sword.
[2394.96s → 2395.96s] I look at Ferny.
[2395.96s → 2397.96s] It's crazy to see your heroes at work.
[2398.96s → 2401.96s] That's a nine plus five.
[2401.96s → 2402.96s] Nine plus five.
[2402.96s → 2403.96s] So that is a 14.
[2403.96s → 2404.96s] You do hit.
[2404.96s → 2405.96s] Which one are you attacking?
[2405.96s → 2406.96s] The one that's attacking Dolores.
[2406.96s → 2407.96s] The one that's attacking Dolores.
[2407.96s → 2408.96s] Okay.
[2408.96s → 2409.96s] Great.
[2409.96s → 2410.96s] So go ahead and roll for damage.
[2410.96s → 2411.96s] 1d6.
[2411.96s → 2412.96s] Take care of the clanking die show.
[2412.96s → 2414.96s] There you have it.
[2414.96s → 2415.96s] Four plus three.
[2415.96s → 2419.96s] This dryad that was been attacking you all with a shalele arm.
[2419.96s → 2421.96s] It is not looking so hot.
[2421.96s → 2422.96s] Like some leaves are starting to fall off.
[2422.96s → 2424.96s] And you can see it take a little bit more of like a tree form
[2424.96s → 2426.96s] and then back to more of a spirit form.
[2426.96s → 2429.96s] It seems to be on its last legs here.
[2429.96s → 2433.96s] Which is good news because next up we have bug.
[2433.96s → 2434.96s] Okay.
[2434.96s → 2436.96s] He's on his last leg.
[2436.96s → 2437.96s] That one.
[2437.96s → 2438.96s] That one.
[2438.96s → 2439.96s] Okay.
[2439.96s → 2440.96s] I'm going to take her.
[2440.96s → 2441.96s] Okay.
[2441.96s → 2442.96s] How are you doing it?
[2442.96s → 2446.96s] I'm going to take her and I'm going to freaking take my light hammer
[2446.96s → 2448.96s] and knock on her like it's freaking judge Judy.
[2448.96s → 2449.96s] Amazing.
[2449.96s → 2450.96s] Roll the hit.
[2450.96s → 2451.96s] Roll the hit.
[2451.96s → 2454.96s] All right 16 plus three.
[2454.96s → 2457.96s] That definitely hits a roll for damage.
[2457.96s → 2458.96s] Okay.
[2458.96s → 2459.96s] That is one.
[2459.96s → 2461.96s] A D4.
[2461.96s → 2463.96s] Then how do I know which one is this?
[2463.96s → 2464.96s] That is a four.
[2464.96s → 2465.96s] Oh yeah four.
[2465.96s → 2466.96s] That is a four plus.
[2466.96s → 2467.96s] Plus one.
[2467.96s → 2468.96s] Four plus one.
[2468.96s → 2469.96s] That's a five.
[2469.96s → 2470.96s] So okay.
[2470.96s → 2473.96s] So you take your hammer and it hits right smack into the middle
[2473.96s → 2474.96s] of the core of this thing.
[2474.96s → 2477.96s] And from the middle it starts to burn up.
[2477.96s → 2480.96s] And you see these little wisps return to the trees in the forest.
[2480.96s → 2482.96s] That dryad is down.
[2482.96s → 2485.96s] The last one that's left looking at good health
[2485.96s → 2487.96s] is the one that's whispering to Furny.
[2487.96s → 2490.96s] And it is unfortunately it's turn.
[2490.96s → 2491.96s] I whisper.
[2491.96s → 2492.96s] I quote a did you see what I did?
[2492.96s → 2493.96s] I did.
[2493.96s → 2494.96s] Yeah.
[2494.96s → 2495.96s] I saw it.
[2495.96s → 2496.96s] Yeah, I know you did.
[2496.96s → 2497.96s] But I just make sure I quote it is.
[2497.96s → 2499.96s] I actually wanted that one.
[2499.96s → 2500.96s] So we can talk later.
[2500.96s → 2501.96s] What?
[2501.96s → 2502.96s] I wanted that one.
[2502.96s → 2504.96s] What do you mean you wanted that one?
[2504.96s → 2505.96s] I keep track of my kills.
[2505.96s → 2507.96s] You took it from him.
[2507.96s → 2510.96s] So the time we're talking about right here.
[2510.96s → 2513.96s] So this dryad that's been whispering to Furny
[2513.96s → 2515.96s] gives him a little like rub on the shoulder
[2515.96s → 2517.96s] and shows that like everything is fine.
[2517.96s → 2518.96s] You know, it just whispers it.
[2518.96s → 2519.96s] I'll be back.
[2519.96s → 2521.96s] And it goes over to you bug.
[2521.96s → 2522.96s] And it, uh...
[2522.96s → 2523.96s] Furny?
[2523.96s → 2524.96s] Or it goes up to me?
[2524.96s → 2525.96s] It goes up to you bug.
[2525.96s → 2528.96s] Because it just watched you kill its friend or whatever it was.
[2528.96s → 2529.96s] And it tries.
[2529.96s → 2532.96s] It doesn't even take the time to turn its arm into that strong stump.
[2532.96s → 2535.96s] It just rakes at you with these flaws here.
[2535.96s → 2539.96s] So tell me, does a ten hit you?
[2539.96s → 2540.96s] Uh, no.
[2540.96s → 2541.96s] Yeah.
[2541.96s → 2542.96s] No, no.
[2542.96s → 2543.96s] It does not.
[2543.96s → 2544.96s] Okay.
[2544.96s → 2545.96s] So it misses with that.
[2545.96s → 2546.96s] And it's just sitting there in rage.
[2546.96s → 2548.96s] And just in time, Furny, it is your turn.
[2548.96s → 2551.96s] Now, you're able to roll that D20 again to see if you can break
[2551.96s → 2553.96s] out of its spell.
[2553.96s → 2554.96s] Okay.
[2554.96s → 2556.96s] So Furny, Furny's there.
[2556.96s → 2557.96s] Spy rolls in his eyes.
[2557.96s → 2561.96s] But he also needs to try to kind of shake it off.
[2561.96s → 2563.96s] He rolls a 15.
[2563.96s → 2564.96s] Ooh.
[2564.96s → 2565.96s] Plus...
[2565.96s → 2567.96s] That's a wisdom.
[2567.96s → 2568.96s] Plus five.
[2568.96s → 2573.96s] So you snap out of it and realize that this thing is going for your friends.
[2573.96s → 2574.96s] And no, this isn't...
[2574.96s → 2576.96s] This isn't your buddy.
[2576.96s → 2578.96s] This is something you actually used to kill all the time.
[2578.96s → 2579.96s] Oh, God.
[2579.96s → 2581.96s] It doesn't need protection from you.
[2581.96s → 2582.96s] You need protection from it.
[2582.96s → 2585.96s] So now you are back to normal for your turn.
[2585.96s → 2586.96s] What would you like to do?
[2586.96s → 2589.96s] Uh, I suddenly come to...
[2589.96s → 2590.96s] I see my friends in trouble.
[2590.96s → 2592.96s] And I see this fey.
[2592.96s → 2595.96s] And it triggers something deeply innate in this thing.
[2595.96s → 2599.96s] And my eyes go dark and then red.
[2599.96s → 2602.96s] And then I'm going to use primal savagery.
[2602.96s → 2605.96s] It's almost like the combat form of this.
[2605.96s → 2610.96s] And then thorns and stuff start to grow out of his hands and everything.
[2610.96s → 2614.96s] Everything sharpens and gets more intense and he just loses it.
[2614.96s → 2618.96s] And it's more like more robotic sounds coming out of him.
[2618.96s → 2623.96s] As he just starts to spin his waist, he's spinning in a helicopter.
[2623.96s → 2625.96s] Running forward at this.
[2625.96s → 2627.96s] So roll to hit.
[2627.96s → 2628.96s] Okay.
[2628.96s → 2629.96s] I look at Coda.
[2629.96s → 2630.96s] It's crazy to see her here.
[2630.96s → 2631.96s] 11 plus five.
[2631.96s → 2632.96s] 11 plus five.
[2632.96s → 2633.96s] So that's a 16.
[2633.96s → 2634.96s] So that definitely hits.
[2634.96s → 2636.96s] So you are whirling into this thing.
[2636.96s → 2640.96s] And as it's like looking at bugger, it just looks up and just takes this hit to the face.
[2640.96s → 2641.96s] Roll for damage.
[2641.96s → 2642.96s] All right.
[2642.96s → 2644.96s] So that's 1d10 acid.
[2644.96s → 2646.96s] Seven.
[2646.96s → 2647.96s] All right.
[2647.96s → 2648.96s] Great.
[2648.96s → 2650.96s] So you do seven damage to this thing, which is a hefty hit.
[2650.96s → 2653.96s] And even though it is a self made of plants, the thorns that you have,
[2653.96s → 2657.96s] something clearly seeps inside of it that just starts to burn at the skin
[2657.96s → 2659.96s] and it's having a real hard time with this.
[2659.96s → 2662.96s] You guys are watching in awe as Ferny just went from being completely useless
[2662.96s → 2664.96s] to being this huge force in battle.
[2664.96s → 2667.96s] And it really gets you revved up.
[2667.96s → 2670.96s] I have never seen his body just turn.
[2670.96s → 2671.96s] Right.
[2671.96s → 2675.96s] So his core just completely switched around.
[2675.96s → 2676.96s] I want to be honest.
[2676.96s → 2677.96s] I've heard a lot about you.
[2677.96s → 2680.96s] And I was so worried when you walked into the tavern and you just said alcohol
[2680.96s → 2681.96s] that you were a dumbass.
[2681.96s → 2682.96s] But you're not.
[2682.96s → 2683.96s] You're my hero.
[2683.96s → 2684.96s] You're strong.
[2684.96s → 2685.96s] He's still in war mode.
[2685.96s → 2686.96s] He's still in war mode.
[2686.96s → 2687.96s] Oh.
[2687.96s → 2689.96s] Oh.
[2689.96s → 2691.96s] Oh.
[2691.96s → 2692.96s] Oh, really.
[2692.96s → 2694.96s] Bugger, you're really playing it cool.
[2694.96s → 2695.96s] Yeah.
[2695.96s → 2698.96s] So Dolores, seeing all this, seeing how Ferny was able to with himself in a shape,
[2698.96s → 2701.96s] even though you've taken a few hits on the head, it is your turn.
[2701.96s → 2702.96s] And it's time for action.
[2702.96s → 2703.96s] What are you going to do?
[2703.96s → 2705.96s] I'm going to use another outridge blast.
[2705.96s → 2706.96s] Incredible.
[2706.96s → 2709.96s] Because these women are just driving me insane.
[2709.96s → 2712.96s] You will attack Ellie.
[2712.96s → 2713.96s] You will attack Ellie.
[2713.96s → 2714.96s] I cook up another one.
[2714.96s → 2717.96s] A fuzzy cute little ball with a smiley face on it.
[2717.96s → 2719.96s] And I start to throw it.
[2719.96s → 2721.96s] That is an 18 plus five.
[2721.96s → 2722.96s] Plus five.
[2722.96s → 2724.96s] That nails right in the face.
[2724.96s → 2727.96s] Give me a damage roll here.
[2727.96s → 2728.96s] Nine plus three.
[2728.96s → 2729.96s] All right.
[2729.96s → 2735.96s] So this fuzzy ball lands extremely delicately on the dry head.
[2735.96s → 2737.96s] The dry head looks down for a moment.
[2737.96s → 2738.96s] Dolores.
[2738.96s → 2742.96s] And there's just colossal blast of eldritch power.
[2742.96s → 2744.96s] Shoot its chest through its back.
[2744.96s → 2749.96s] And again, the whips start to disintegrate and return to the trees.
[2749.96s → 2750.96s] Bye.
[2750.96s → 2752.96s] Survived this encounter.
[2752.96s → 2754.96s] Not only that, you did it with flying colors.
[2754.96s → 2756.96s] Four things in the forest attacked you.
[2756.96s → 2758.96s] And you survived.
[2758.96s → 2759.96s] Can't break the power of love.
[2759.96s → 2760.96s] That's right.
[2760.96s → 2764.96s] So right after this gunthar starts trotting up with the,
[2764.96s → 2768.96s] with the horse and with the revamped carriage here situation.
[2768.96s → 2771.96s] And he's like, hey, it's not that old thing.
[2771.96s → 2773.96s] I just kind of wanted to see what you all could do.
[2773.96s → 2774.96s] Yeah.
[2774.96s → 2775.96s] So it's a crossbow.
[2775.96s → 2776.96s] It isn't me.
[2776.96s → 2777.96s] Hey.
[2777.96s → 2778.96s] The crossbow is new.
[2778.96s → 2779.96s] Listen.
[2779.96s → 2781.96s] I know you're trying to prove yourself to them today.
[2781.96s → 2782.96s] I don't know what that even means.
[2782.96s → 2783.96s] You don't prove yourself to me.
[2783.96s → 2784.96s] Listen.
[2784.96s → 2785.96s] You don't have to prove yourself to me.
[2785.96s → 2786.96s] We had a good talk over there.
[2786.96s → 2787.96s] All right.
[2787.96s → 2788.96s] Yeah.
[2788.96s → 2789.96s] You're safe.
[2789.96s → 2790.96s] There's a safe space.
[2790.96s → 2791.96s] Don't look at me right now.
[2791.96s → 2792.96s] My brains are out.
[2792.96s → 2793.96s] Look.
[2793.96s → 2794.96s] Your brains are out.
[2794.96s → 2796.96s] It's, uh, your hair is, uh, there's a little bit in your face.
[2796.96s → 2798.96s] Let me just move that for you real quick.
[2798.96s → 2800.96s] We got to get this bandaged up for you.
[2800.96s → 2801.96s] Don't worry.
[2801.96s → 2802.96s] I've got a, uh, here, uh, drink this.
[2802.96s → 2804.96s] I haven't finished in a long time.
[2804.96s → 2805.96s] Jesus.
[2805.96s → 2806.96s] Right.
[2806.96s → 2807.96s] Holy shit.
[2807.96s → 2809.96s] You just eldritch blasted as someone and you're,
[2809.96s → 2810.96s] because he touched your head.
[2810.96s → 2812.96s] We haven't finished.
[2812.96s → 2813.96s] We're not there yet, guys.
[2813.96s → 2814.96s] That's right.
[2814.96s → 2815.96s] He's right.
[2815.96s → 2816.96s] You're right for him.
[2816.96s → 2817.96s] Drink this health potion.
[2817.96s → 2818.96s] I got a couple more in back there.
[2818.96s → 2819.96s] You know what?
[2819.96s → 2820.96s] Drink that health potion.
[2820.96s → 2821.96s] You took a little damage to you.
[2821.96s → 2822.96s] I did.
[2822.96s → 2823.96s] I did.
[2823.96s → 2824.96s] Oh, thank you.
[2824.96s → 2825.96s] Oh, wow.
[2825.96s → 2826.96s] Both of y'all restore, uh, four health.
[2826.96s → 2827.96s] Nice.
[2827.96s → 2828.96s] Thank you so much.
[2828.96s → 2831.96s] Y'all hop in a Gunthars carriage to continue the last leg of the trip here.
[2831.96s → 2834.96s] And although that battle did take you a minute and the sun has said,
[2834.96s → 2836.96s] it's not quite that late.
[2836.96s → 2838.96s] We're talking 9 p.m.
[2838.96s → 2839.96s] So you're still right on time.
[2839.96s → 2841.96s] The delivery has to be made by morning.
[2841.96s → 2843.96s] So you're feeling pretty good about things.
[2843.96s → 2844.96s] Furny.
[2844.96s → 2846.96s] Dude, what was she saying to you back then?
[2846.96s → 2848.96s] Oh, she was saying you.
[2848.96s → 2849.96s] Funny.
[2849.96s → 2850.96s] Don't do that.
[2850.96s → 2853.96s] Furny, you have to be really careful of women like that.
[2853.96s → 2855.96s] You can't just talk to crazy wooden trees.
[2855.96s → 2858.96s] They'll take all your money.
[2858.96s → 2861.96s] She didn't try to take any of my money, though.
[2861.96s → 2863.96s] She just asked me to protect her.
[2863.96s → 2864.96s] Oh.
[2864.96s → 2865.96s] Oh.
[2865.96s → 2866.96s] Yeah.
[2866.96s → 2869.96s] From Gunthars' lap, I go, well, it felt like she knew you from somewhere.
[2869.96s → 2870.96s] Yeah.
[2870.96s → 2871.96s] Did y'all date?
[2871.96s → 2872.96s] No.
[2872.96s → 2873.96s] Oh, good, good, good.
[2873.96s → 2875.96s] No, I never dated her.
[2875.96s → 2876.96s] So hot.
[2876.96s → 2878.96s] Have you dated anybody, Furny?
[2878.96s → 2880.96s] I don't think so.
[2880.96s → 2881.96s] Okay.
[2881.96s → 2882.96s] Virgin.
[2882.96s → 2883.96s] Virgin.
[2883.96s → 2884.96s] Good.
[2884.96s → 2885.96s] Sounds like a virgin.
[2885.96s → 2886.96s] Keep it that way.
[2886.96s → 2887.96s] Yeah.
[2887.96s → 2889.96s] So, um, that was pretty awesome.
[2889.96s → 2890.96s] Yeah.
[2890.96s → 2892.96s] You threw that soft little softball at her.
[2892.96s → 2893.96s] What is that?
[2893.96s → 2894.96s] Blue or chest through her back.
[2894.96s → 2896.96s] Well, it's a specialty that I have.
[2896.96s → 2898.96s] That was really scary.
[2898.96s → 2899.96s] Yeah.
[2899.96s → 2900.96s] I blew a hole through her whole body.
[2900.96s → 2901.96s] Yeah.
[2901.96s → 2902.96s] It was awful.
[2902.96s → 2905.96s] She looked like she was in severe pain and seeing hell as she was leaving.
[2905.96s → 2906.96s] Oh, poor girl.
[2906.96s → 2909.96s] I could hear some other worldly screams coming from her.
[2909.96s → 2912.96s] It looked like an anti-smoking commercial.
[2912.96s → 2915.96s] Stop watching so much TV bug.
[2915.96s → 2917.96s] Bug, your crossbow.
[2917.96s → 2918.96s] That really was embarrassing.
[2918.96s → 2921.96s] Yeah, that was a little rough for all of us, actually.
[2921.96s → 2922.96s] It's okay, sweetie.
[2922.96s → 2925.96s] But it was kind of cool that you managed to hit your own shoe
[2925.96s → 2926.96s] and nail it into the ground.
[2926.96s → 2927.96s] Yeah.
[2927.96s → 2929.96s] If that's what you were trying to do, then that's awesome.
[2929.96s → 2931.96s] Yeah, that's what I was trying to do.
[2931.96s → 2932.96s] The shoe was bothering me.
[2932.96s → 2933.96s] Bad ass.
[2933.96s → 2934.96s] Um, yeah.
[2934.96s → 2935.96s] I had that one, though.
[2935.96s → 2936.96s] Yeah.
[2936.96s → 2937.96s] It's just a record.
[2937.96s → 2938.96s] Yeah, yeah.
[2938.96s → 2939.96s] I want to apologize.
[2939.96s → 2942.96s] If there's any like no, like anything you think that I can do better at.
[2942.96s → 2945.96s] Yeah, maybe shoot the target the first time.
[2945.96s → 2946.96s] Okay, Kota.
[2946.96s → 2948.96s] Bug's really trying.
[2948.96s → 2949.96s] Like, he's been trying.
[2949.96s → 2951.96s] Okay, please don't be my mom right now.
[2951.96s → 2953.96s] You know, I don't know what else to be.
[2953.96s → 2959.96s] That felt like a man to be like, well, that's the mic.
[2959.96s → 2960.96s] That's my thing.
[2960.96s → 2961.96s] Oh, my God.
[2961.96s → 2962.96s] That's it.
[2962.96s → 2963.96s] That's it.
[2963.96s → 2964.96s] That's it.
[2964.96s → 2965.96s] That's my character game.
[2965.96s → 2967.96s] That's my character game, honey.
[2967.96s → 2969.96s] Dog, that was the primal savagery right there.
[2969.96s → 2970.96s] Yeah.
[2970.96s → 2971.96s] Um, all right.
[2971.96s → 2975.96s] So Gunther turns to you, bug, and he's just like, hey, can I make a recommendation?
[2975.96s → 2976.96s] Take sorry out of your vocabulary.
[2976.96s → 2978.96s] Replace it with thank you.
[2978.96s → 2980.96s] Thank you for bearing with me while I work through some things.
[2980.96s → 2982.96s] You know, stuff like that.
[2982.96s → 2983.96s] Gunther, dude, that was a great advice.
[2983.96s → 2985.96s] That is so hot and kind.
[2985.96s → 2986.96s] Thank you.
[2986.96s → 2987.96s] You're welcome.
[2987.96s → 2990.96s] As the night gets a little bit later, but not too late.
[2990.96s → 2993.96s] Start seeing the distance from tall wooden stakes.
[2993.96s → 2998.96s] And as the mist clears in this maritime forest, and we start to smell even more salt like you're
[2998.96s → 3002.96s] even closer to the ocean, you realize this is an entire encampment.
[3002.96s → 3006.96s] Uh, wooden walls as far as the eye can see, but you can tell they bend in a little bit
[3006.96s → 3007.96s] circularly.
[3007.96s → 3010.96s] So this is definitely your destination.
[3010.96s → 3012.96s] Gunther points out, ah, we're here.
[3012.96s → 3014.96s] The settlement in the Gendel marshes.
[3014.96s → 3016.96s] This is Gendel.
[3016.96s → 3018.96s] This is where I leave you all.
[3018.96s → 3021.96s] I've got to make your delivery in there and I'll be waiting when you're done.
[3021.96s → 3023.96s] I thought you were going to spend the night.
[3023.96s → 3025.96s] I've got to watch the carriage.
[3025.96s → 3026.96s] Thank you, Gunther.
[3026.96s → 3027.96s] I really appreciate it.
[3027.96s → 3028.96s] Hey, bug.
[3028.96s → 3029.96s] You know I've got you.
[3029.96s → 3033.96s] All right, just lift up one hoof and then one hand to also hit like you know.
[3033.96s → 3035.96s] They're gonna be like, yeah.
[3035.96s → 3036.96s] Good luck in there, y'all.
[3036.96s → 3039.96s] And hey, I've got any advice for you.
[3039.96s → 3042.96s] Just beep a light around these guys, okay?
[3042.96s → 3043.96s] Okay.
[3043.96s → 3045.96s] I'll write you.
[3045.96s → 3046.96s] All right.
[3046.96s → 3047.96s] You.
[3047.96s → 3048.96s] Oh, no.
[3048.96s → 3049.96s] You're done.
[3049.96s → 3050.96s] All right.
[3050.96s → 3054.96s] After Gunther walks away, I turned everyone I go.
[3054.96s → 3057.96s] You know, he was a really weird looking horse.
[3057.96s → 3064.96s] Gunther is like, only a few feet from you.
[3064.96s → 3066.96s] Just turns back around.
[3066.96s → 3073.96s] And just says like, hey, he brought us the whole way here.
[3073.96s → 3074.96s] All right.
[3074.96s → 3075.96s] All right.
[3075.96s → 3078.96s] So he just like sort of sidles up to the side of the road here.
[3078.96s → 3081.96s] It starts like putting together a tent to like care for the horse and care for the carriage
[3081.96s → 3083.96s] and just keep watching things.
[3083.96s → 3084.96s] Ollie the way.
[3084.96s → 3085.96s] Right?
[3085.96s → 3086.96s] Good.
[3086.96s → 3088.96s] Bug and I are.
[3088.96s → 3092.96s] Furny and Kota can see right over us, but we are going to both.
[3092.96s → 3093.96s] I love that marching order.
[3093.96s → 3098.96s] Well, I feel like we should probably not like three times as normally.
[3098.96s → 3101.96s] And there's no guards or anything out front.
[3101.96s → 3102.96s] Give me a roll at the perception.
[3102.96s → 3103.96s] That's a 16.
[3103.96s → 3109.96s] And so Furny is walking up kind of like some weird gadgets and gizmos come out of his head
[3109.96s → 3113.96s] to kind of observe and analyze the front gate area.
[3113.96s → 3118.96s] So you can see at the very top of the gates, there's clearly a platform on the other side
[3118.96s → 3121.96s] and there's two little guys looking over.
[3121.96s → 3124.96s] You can't quite make out their shape quite yet, but they're aware that you're here
[3124.96s → 3127.96s] and they look really excited and really ready.
[3127.96s → 3130.96s] They look really ready for you to start knocking or saying something.
[3130.96s → 3131.96s] Hello!
[3131.96s → 3132.96s] Hi!
[3132.96s → 3137.96s] Guys, we're here to deliver immediately before you even finish your sentence.
[3137.96s → 3140.96s] One of them jumps down from this 15-foot tall gate,
[3140.96s → 3145.96s] lands directly in front of you with this flourish and bows deeply.
[3145.96s → 3146.96s] Oh.
[3146.96s → 3147.96s] Welcome, everyone.
[3147.96s → 3148.96s] Welcome.
[3148.96s → 3150.96s] My name is Rumpum, the greeter of the gates.
[3150.96s → 3153.96s] And who are all of you?
[3153.96s → 3154.96s] The greeter of the gates.
[3154.96s → 3155.96s] The greeter of the gates.
[3155.96s → 3157.96s] It is my official title.
[3157.96s → 3159.96s] I'm the one who greets those who visit our gates.
[3160.96s → 3161.96s] Good social skills.
[3161.96s → 3164.96s] The greeter of the gates, you have to understand that sounds like you're greeting gates.
[3164.96s → 3166.96s] I am greeting you and I am at the gates.
[3166.96s → 3168.96s] I will work on it, though.
[3168.96s → 3170.96s] He bows even more deeply.
[3170.96s → 3171.96s] Oh, my goodness.
[3171.96s → 3173.96s] So you see in front of you, he is about three feet tall.
[3173.96s → 3175.96s] He is like a frog.
[3175.96s → 3178.96s] This is very much a little frog person.
[3178.96s → 3181.96s] Hence the jumping abilities and all that good stuff.
[3181.96s → 3185.96s] He's dressed in what you can tell used to be rags, but have been cobbled into some finery,
[3185.96s → 3190.96s] maybe with some like found pieces of metal, and maybe with some like bones and things from the forest.
[3190.96s → 3194.96s] But you can tell he's very dressed very proper to make a right entrance.
[3194.96s → 3197.96s] I love when someone dresses up for guests.
[3197.96s → 3198.96s] I'm Dolores.
[3198.96s → 3199.96s] Hi Dolores.
[3199.96s → 3200.96s] I'm Charmed.
[3200.96s → 3201.96s] I'm sure.
[3201.96s → 3203.96s] It's a crazy name.
[3203.96s → 3206.96s] No, my name is Rumpum, the greeter of the gates.
[3206.96s → 3207.96s] It's my title.
[3207.96s → 3208.96s] Charmed for sure.
[3208.96s → 3214.96s] And then you hear a voice coming from above being like, I am Crawley, the opener of the gates.
[3214.96s → 3217.96s] Is it time for me to open the gates?
[3217.96s → 3218.96s] It is.
[3218.96s → 3220.96s] I need confirmation from Rumpum.
[3220.96s → 3221.96s] Rumpum?
[3221.96s → 3222.96s] It's time.
[3222.96s → 3223.96s] Okay.
[3223.96s → 3224.96s] Sorry for doubting you.
[3224.96s → 3225.96s] It's okay.
[3225.96s → 3232.96s] And with the sound of a crank, a large crank, the gates slowly start to open.
[3232.96s → 3238.96s] And what were clearly just cobbled together and tied pieces of logs and wood making these gates,
[3238.96s → 3242.96s] belie the beautiful insights?
[3242.96s → 3250.96s] Stone pathways, clearly made by very expert mason's, lead to a beautiful city center with a fountain,
[3250.96s → 3252.96s] and it's bustling with life.
[3252.96s → 3256.96s] There are lights everywhere, frog people everywhere.
[3256.96s → 3261.96s] There's children laughing and playing in the streets, performers dancing with little sparklers
[3261.96s → 3263.96s] and even a juggler there.
[3263.96s → 3266.96s] And there are people handing out foods that aren't quite familiar to you,
[3266.96s → 3271.96s] but the children most of all seem excited to get these as though they're treats of some kind.
[3271.96s → 3272.96s] Do I grab one?
[3272.96s → 3273.96s] You grab one.
[3273.96s → 3274.96s] Fantastic.
[3274.96s → 3275.96s] They're like, uh, hello.
[3275.96s → 3276.96s] I'm, I'm Jimmy.
[3276.96s → 3278.96s] I'm Jimmy, the maker of the treats.
[3278.96s → 3280.96s] Well, Jimmy, can you give me some treats?
[3280.96s → 3281.96s] Coda.
[3281.96s → 3282.96s] Sorry.
[3282.96s → 3285.96s] That is the first, that is the first time.
[3285.96s → 3286.96s] No, that can't be.
[3286.96s → 3287.96s] That's cool.
[3287.96s → 3288.96s] I'm serious.
[3288.96s → 3292.96s] I am Jimmy, maker of the treats, and that is the first time.
[3292.96s → 3301.96s] So, um, Rumpum begins to lead y'all into what is clearly this well-built town hidden in the middle of the forest.
[3301.96s → 3304.96s] All occupied by frog people.
[3304.96s → 3307.96s] Rumpum, um, says, come.
[3307.96s → 3312.96s] Although I am greeter of the gates, I can be off duty for a moment to bring you inside.
[3312.96s → 3314.96s] And then someone pops up from the bottom.
[3314.96s → 3315.96s] They said, I'm Chomo.
[3315.96s → 3316.96s] Bringer of the visitors and stuff.
[3316.96s → 3317.96s] And I've got this.
[3317.96s → 3318.96s] I've got this.
[3319.96s → 3322.96s] Uh, and Rumpum takes your hand, Alores, and says, come.
[3322.96s → 3324.96s] Let us, let us waltz inside.
[3324.96s → 3325.96s] So cute.
[3325.96s → 3326.96s] Thank you.
[3326.96s → 3327.96s] So little.
[3327.96s → 3330.96s] I'm glad I can see a woman who recognizes herself cute and little.
[3330.96s → 3333.96s] I'm so glad your visitors have arrived in time.
[3333.96s → 3335.96s] For you see tonight is the festival.
[3335.96s → 3339.96s] We weren't expecting you till morning, but now you get to take part in the celebrations.
[3339.96s → 3340.96s] Isn't this wonderful?
[3340.96s → 3341.96s] Aren't the lights fantastic?
[3341.96s → 3343.96s] Welcome to Grandel.
[3343.96s → 3345.96s] You need a little lotion on your hands or a bit rough.
[3345.96s → 3347.96s] No, I'm so embarrassed.
[3347.96s → 3348.96s] Oh, no, no, no.
[3348.96s → 3349.96s] He whistles real quick.
[3349.96s → 3353.96s] And then a little guy pops up and he's like, I'm Tomo.
[3353.96s → 3354.96s] The lotion.
[3354.96s → 3355.96s] Yeah.
[3355.96s → 3356.96s] I could have told you.
[3356.96s → 3357.96s] I could know.
[3357.96s → 3358.96s] We could have guessed.
[3358.96s → 3360.96s] You guys are really delicate with all your jobs here.
[3360.96s → 3361.96s] Yeah.
[3361.96s → 3362.96s] Big on our titles.
[3362.96s → 3363.96s] Do you need some lotion?
[3363.96s → 3364.96s] Uh, no, that frog.
[3364.96s → 3365.96s] No, I am.
[3365.96s → 3366.96s] Audi.
[3366.96s → 3367.96s] Oh, okay.
[3367.96s → 3370.96s] And he's just like, Rumpum is like.
[3370.96s → 3376.96s] So as you're all having this interaction, um, you see all the frogs start to turn one by one.
[3376.96s → 3378.96s] Almost like a wave they are turning.
[3378.96s → 3379.96s] Oh.
[3379.96s → 3380.96s] They are turning their turning.
[3380.96s → 3383.96s] And this shadowed presence starts to walk and make its way towards you.
[3383.96s → 3392.96s] And as it walks into the torch light, you see that this is another frog person but much larger and must much more regally dressed.
[3392.96s → 3393.96s] I bow.
[3393.96s → 3396.96s] All the frogs bow even more deeply.
[3396.96s → 3398.96s] The second coat of bow's I bow.
[3398.96s → 3399.96s] Oh.
[3399.96s → 3400.96s] Fantastic.
[3400.96s → 3401.96s] All the frogs bow.
[3401.96s → 3407.96s] For he just kind of like, like at a 90 degree angle just like turn.
[3407.96s → 3409.96s] Thank you for your deep bows.
[3409.96s → 3412.96s] Clearly you have studied our customs.
[3412.96s → 3414.96s] My name is Garland.
[3414.96s → 3415.96s] It is a name.
[3415.96s → 3417.96s] Shaman of our civilization.
[3417.96s → 3419.96s] Keeper of our culture.
[3419.96s → 3421.96s] Reader of tones.
[3421.96s → 3426.96s] And you are early.
[3426.96s → 3428.96s] It's my crossbow.
[3428.96s → 3431.96s] And that is where we will end the first episode.
[3431.96s → 3432.96s] Yeah.
[3432.96s → 3436.96s] Thank you guys so much for watching the first episode of Sword AF.
[3436.96s → 3440.96s] We are so excited to play out the entirety of this campaign for you.
[3440.96s → 3446.96s] So please come on back and see what these amazing heroes get up to if they earn that title.
[3446.96s → 3447.96s] Oh.
[3447.96s → 3449.96s] Oh, shit.
[3449.96s → 3450.96s] We will.
